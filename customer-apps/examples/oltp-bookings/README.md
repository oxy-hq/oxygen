# OLTP Bookings — `ctx.oltp` example

A minimal custom app that reads and **writes** its own per-org OLTP store through
`ctx.oltp`. It's the smallest complete demonstration of the app-writer path: a
booking form that inserts rows the app owns, and lists them back.

## Why `ctx.oltp` and not `ctx.warehouse`

`ctx.warehouse` targets the databases the *project* analyses. For a
`postgres_managed` database it resolves the org's **read-only analyst**, so:

- a write authenticates and then fails `permission denied`, and
- a read sees the org's whole warehouse — the `raw_*` Toast/QuickBooks extracts
  included, which is wider than an app should have.

`ctx.oltp` resolves the app's own **writer** role instead. Its DML rights are
scoped to the single `app_<writer>` schema (`app_oltp_bookings` here) and nothing
else — narrower on reads, and finally writable. The app never names a database:
its own store is implicit.

## The capability

`oxy-app.json` declares it on the function, fail-closed:

```json
"functions": {
  "bookings": { "route": true, "oltp": { "enabled": true } }
}
```

`enabled` is a pure **gate** — it does not name a schema. The target is derived
from the app's own slug host-side (`oltp-bookings` → `app_oltp_bookings`), so a
manifest can never point `ctx.oltp` at another app's data. Omit the capability
and every `ctx.oltp` call is rejected before any connection is opened.

## Setup

1. **The org operator provisions the store once** (mints the
   `app_oltp_bookings_rw` role + schema — the writer name is the app slug with
   hyphens as underscores):

   ```sh
   oxy oltp provision --org <org> --writer app:oltp_bookings
   ```

2. **Publish the app:**

   ```sh
   oxyc publish
   ```

Per-org OLTP is always on, so step 1 is the only precondition: until the store
is provisioned, `ctx.oltp` fails with an error naming the missing database or
writer rather than reaching anything.

## Using it

[`functions/bookings.ts`](functions/bookings.ts) handles one route:

- `{ "action": "list" }` → the 100 most recent bookings.
- `{ "action": "create", "name": "Ada", "partySize": 4 }` → inserts one row and
  returns it (`INSERT … RETURNING`).

From the app's frontend:

```ts
const { invoke } = useFunction("bookings");
await invoke({ action: "create", name: "Ada", partySize: 4 });
const { bookings } = await invoke({ action: "list" });
```

## Security note

Every value from the request is passed as a **bound parameter** (`$1`, `$2`, …),
never concatenated into SQL. A booking form is exactly the surface that takes
end-user input; placeholders are the only thing that makes it safe. `ctx.oltp`
runs each statement in a one-shot transaction, so a rejected write rolls back
rather than leaving a partial row.
