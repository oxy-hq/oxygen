// `oxyApp()` handles everything Oxy-specific: it validates `oxy-app.json`,
// copies it into the build output, proxies `/api` to your local oxy server in
// dev, and resolves the base path the bundle is served under.
//
// The base path resolves from (in order):
//   1. `OXY_APP_BASE_PATH` — `oxyc publish` sets this from the org it resolves
//      for the target environment, so the org is never hardcoded here.
//   2. `/` — the dev fallback, fine for `pnpm dev` and a standalone build.
//
// For a standalone build against a specific org:
//   OXY_APP_BASE_PATH=/customer-apps/oxy-canary/platform-canary/ pnpm build
