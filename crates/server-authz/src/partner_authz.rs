//! Partner authorization — "may this user administer this client org, and with
//! what permissions?"
//!
//! Model: `internal-docs/partner-platform.md`.
//!
//! ## The shape
//!
//! A partner is not an entity — it is a **grant an organization holds**. Its people
//! are ordinary `org_members` of that org who additionally hold **partner access**
//! (a `partner_role_bindings` row). So:
//!
//! ```text
//! authority(user, target_org) = ceiling                     // what Oxy allows the partner
//!                             ∩ has_access(user)             // is this member an operator
//!                             ∩ (target_org ∈ partner's clients)
//! ```
//!
//! The **ceiling** is `partner_capabilities` — Oxy's grant to the partner, and the
//! whole capability story: there are no per-person roles and no per-client scope.
//! Every operator reaches every client and can do exactly what the ceiling allows.
//!
//! ## The load-bearing decision (unchanged)
//!
//! Partner power flows through this capability-gated surface — it is **never**
//! injected as a synthetic membership into `OrgContext`. A partner admin given a
//! synthetic Org Admin membership would silently pass `OrgAdminStrict` (billing /
//! admin-promotion) regardless of their permissions. Making a partner org-backed
//! changed *identity and home*, not *enforcement*: this module stays additive and
//! the org/workspace guards are untouched.
//!
//! Everything here **fails closed**: a DB error, a missing ceiling row, a suspended
//! grant, or no partner-access binding all resolve to "no access".
//!
//! ## Where authorization lives — read it in this order
//!
//! Four files, one flow:
//!
//! 1. **Vocabulary** — [`PartnerCapability`] (this file): the closed set of
//!    permissions. The single source of truth; everything below derives from it.
//! 2. **Ceiling** — [`Capabilities`] (this file) + the `partner_capabilities`
//!    table: which of those a given partner was granted (Oxy-set, per partner).
//! 3. **Decision** — `authz::partner_allows`, which asks the unified model
//!    (`Ring::PartnerCap` in `oxy-authz`): the capability must come from the partner
//!    being ACTED AS, and — for an org-scoped action — the org must be one of its
//!    clients. The partner tier used to carry its own Cedar policy for this; there is
//!    now one model for all of Oxy's authorization, and no engine.
//! 4. **Enforcement** — `partner_console::require_org_scope` (org-scoped actions) and
//!    the custom-app gate (via [`partner_grants_app_access`], in this file) call the
//!    decision and map a Deny to 403/404. This is where a handler opts a route into a
//!    capability.
//!
//! ## Extending it
//!
//! **Add a capability** (say `manage_schedules`):
//!   1. Migration: add a `partner_capabilities.manage_schedules` boolean.
//!   2. In this file: add the [`PartnerCapability`] variant + its `as_str` arm +
//!      its [`PartnerCapability::ALL`] entry; add the [`Capabilities`] field + its
//!      `from_model` / `allows` / `set` arms. The compiler forces every one of
//!      these **except the `ALL` entry** — that is the single step you must remember.
//!   3. In `authz`: add the matching `Cap` variant + `Action` + its `Ring::PartnerCap`
//!      mapping. The compiler forces the `cap_of` / `partner_action` arms, so it will
//!      not let you half-do this.
//!   4. Enforce it: at the handler, `require_org_scope(&db, &scope, org_id,
//!      PartnerCapability::ManageSchedules)`.
//!
//! **Gate a new endpoint on an existing capability**: just call `require_org_scope`
//! (or check the cap in the custom-app gate). No policy or vocabulary change.
//!
//! **Change what a capability *means*** (the rule, not the name): edit `Ring::PartnerCap`
//! in `oxy_authz::allows` — the one place every capability's rule is stated. If a
//! capability ever needs a non-uniform rule, give it its own `Ring` there.
//!
//! §2–§3 of the design doc is the prose version of this map.
