//! The routers `oxy-app` mounts without declaring a role must not reach disk.
//!
//! A merge at a tree's ROOT has no prefix to hang a declaration on, so
//! `RoleRouter::merge_undeclared` mounts those routers and their routes fall to
//! `classify`'s FleetOk default — the one hole the type-level gate cannot close.
//!
//! That is safe today for a reason nothing was checking: neither crate reaches
//! the workspace working copy, `.git`, or the local state dir at all. Measured
//! when this file was written — `oxy-cameras` mounts 75 routes and `airhouse` 6,
//! and the count of workspace-FS accesses across both crates is zero.
//!
//! So the guard is not "classify these routes correctly", it is "keep them
//! diskless". A camera handler that started reading the working copy would be
//! served on a replica that has none, with nothing to catch it — the exact
//! failure this branch exists to make unrepresentable.
