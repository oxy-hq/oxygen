//! Boundary test: the custom-apps surface must stay behind a thin, named set of seams.
//!
//! ## Why a source-scanning test
//!
//! The custom-apps surface is ~17.5k LOC across ~35 tightly-cohesive `custom_apps_*`
//! modules (plus the `custom_app_template` scaffold). An audit found it is *already*
//! well-bounded — it reaches the rest of `oxy-app` through only a handful of seams, and
//! it carries its own request context (`CustomAppContext`) rather than threading
//! `AppState`. That thinness is the whole reason the surface is legible and testable.
//!
//! But nothing *keeps* it thin. The shortest path when a custom-apps handler needs
//! something from billing, or admin, or a new service is to reach straight into that
//! module — and the boundary erodes one reasonable import at a time, exactly the way the
//! ~170-site authz scatter got built (see `authz_boundaries.rs`). A reviewer who doesn't
//! already hold the boundary in their head won't catch it. So the objection has to be
//! mechanical: this test fails the build when a custom-apps file imports an `oxy-app`
//! module outside the sanctioned seam list.
//!
//! ## The allowlist IS the coupling, written down — and shrinking it is the migration
//!
//! Each [`ALLOWED_SEAMS`] entry is a real dependency the surface has *today*, with the
//! reason it's tolerated. The list going UP means new coupling crept in (justify it or
//! don't add it). The list going DOWN — deleting a seam once its last import is gone — is
//! measurable progress toward making the surface extractable. The heaviest remaining seam,
//! `agentic_wiring::OxyProjectContext`, is the next target to invert behind a trait
//! (`server::api::projects` already was); when it's gone, a real Functions crate becomes feasible.
//!
//! To keep the list honest in both directions, [`no_unused_seams`] fails if an allowlisted
//! seam has no importer left — you cannot narrow the coupling and leave the entry behind.
//!
//! ## Precision over reach
//!
//! Only file-level and local `use` of `crate::`/`super::` paths are scanned; `#[cfg(test)]`
//! modules are skipped (their `use super::*` is an intra-file idiom, not a seam). Anything
//! naming a `custom_app*` segment is intra-cluster and ignored. A test that cries wolf gets
//! deleted, and then it protects nothing.
//!
//! ## Known gap — cross-crate paths are invisible here, by construction
//!
//! Only `crate::`/`super::`/`self::` paths are scanned, so an `oxy_*::` import of a
//! workspace sibling is not a seam and never will be flagged. That is deliberate and it is
//! the same thing the two `REMOVED 2026-07-27` notes above celebrate: when a dependency
//! moves DOWN into a crate both sides can depend on (`oxy-server-authz`, `oxy-shared`,
//! `oxy-app-core`), the `oxy-app` back-edge really is gone and deleting the seam really is
//! progress. The gap is that the test cannot tell that move apart from a move made purely
//! to dodge it — extracting a module to a sibling crate deletes a seam entry with no
//! review signal. Closing it means teaching the scanner which sibling crates are
//! sanctioned shared seams (`oxy-app-core`) versus which are feature crates custom-apps
//! must not reach into, which is a different model than the one this file implements.
//! Until then it stays a reviewer's obligation: an extraction that shrinks
//! [`ALLOWED_SEAMS`] should say where the coupling went.
