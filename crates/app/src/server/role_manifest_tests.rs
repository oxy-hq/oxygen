// in `build_workspace_routes` (router/workspace.rs) and asserts each is
// EXPLICITLY classified — IdeOnly by its `route_ide` mount, or acknowledged
// FleetOk below. A new mount nobody classified fails CI here instead of
// silently defaulting to FleetOk and 404ing on a serve replica that has no
// working copy (the `/apps/source` outage class, oxygen-internal#2531).
//
// Scope/limits (honest): it guards the top-level mount surface. It does not
// introspect nested builders' sub-routes (axum exposes no route table) nor
// per-method gaps inside a builder — those stay guarded by the per-builder
// tests above + the behavioral canary (internal-docs/compile-boundary.md).
// `.merge(...)` mounts carry no path literal (git: see
// `manifest_covers_every_git_route`).

/// Workspace mounts whose DEFAULT is FleetOk: served statelessly (compile
/// boundary + Postgres + S3). Kept in sync with `build_workspace_routes` —
/// the test rejects stale entries.
///
/// A mount here may still be **MIXED** — `/apps`, `/tests` and
/// `/integrations` each have IdeOnly sub-routes. This list cannot express
/// that: `every_workspace_mount_is_classified` short-circuits on a match, so
/// an entry here means "do not ask about the mount", not "nothing under it
/// touches disk". The earlier wording claimed the latter and was false the
/// moment a sub-route was pinned.
