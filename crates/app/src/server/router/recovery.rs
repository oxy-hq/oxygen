    // with a compile AND any other pending Global run still reached the drive.

    // unwanted (heavy work on the ide, see `drive_policy_for`) as its driver.

    // may claim the row, so the deferring process re-selects its own work
    // every few seconds while its heartbeat excludes every other node from
    // `find_pending_global_runs` entirely — ending in a dead-lettered queue
    // row and a run stuck non-terminal.

    // therefore selectable by the next eligible tick. That is the handoff the
    // other approaches only claimed.

    // Same policy as the gate, and the same VALUE: `policy` is this tick's
    // argument, passed on to `drive_pending`, and split here by the same
    // `partition_drivable` the gate uses. A probe that skips MORE than the
    // gate silently hides drivable work, so neither consults the policy for
    // itself.
    // Kept whole for `retire_orphaned_runs` below. Retiring a run whose
    // workspace row is gone is a plain DB write that needs no workspace
    // context, so it is NOT a capability this node can lack — filtering it by
    // the driving exclusion would let an orphan of a declined kind sit
    // un-retired, which is the shape that pinned the pool on 2026-09-01.
    // Cheap: a clone of a handful of small structs, only on ticks that found
    // pending work at all.
    //
    // **Scope: the workspaces this node visits.** `workspaces` below is built
    // from the POST-partition list, so a deleted workspace whose only pending
    // runs are of a declined kind is never visited and `all_pending` is never
    // consulted for it. On a split fleet the other role covers that case — a
    // worker retires orphaned airway, an ide retires orphaned compile — so it
    // is not a stranding. Building `workspaces` from `all_pending` instead
    // would close it, at the cost of a per-tick workspace lookup (every 300 ms)
