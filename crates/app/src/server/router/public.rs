//! Routes that do not require authentication: health probes, auth endpoints,
//! current-user lookup, and provider-originated webhooks/callbacks (Slack,
//! Toast, and per-app function webhooks).
//!
//! "No auth gate" here means no *user session*, not "no caller check". The
//! webhook receivers authenticate the SENDER instead, by HMAC over the raw
//! body — see `webhooks::app_function`, which fails closed twice (undeclared
//! webhook → 404, unresolvable secret → 401) precisely because it is anonymous.
//!
//! Every route here is `route_fleet`, and that is a declaration of what was
//! already true rather than a change: this file used to mount 51 routes with a
//! bare `.route(`, so every one of them took `classify`'s FleetOk default. The
//! difference is that the default is silent and a declaration is not — and
//! `route_fleet` takes a `MethodRouter<FleetState>`, so a handler added here
//! that asks for `WorkspaceManagerWorkingCopy` now fails to compile instead of
//! shipping as a route a stateless replica cannot serve.
//!
//! None of the current handlers asks for one (checked), which is why the
//! conversion is behaviour-preserving. What it does NOT fix is a handler that
//! reaches for disk without an extractor — `POST /projects/{id}/query` answers
//! `cannot resolve path '.db/'` on a replica while returning rows on the ide,
//! and stays FleetOk deliberately: `role_manifest_tests`'
//! `the_customer_app_data_plane_is_fleet_ok` pins that, and the DuckDB-`local`
//! limitation is recorded in `customer-apps-oxy-starter-fleet.flow.test.yml`.
