//! `POST /api/customer-apps/publish` — the one-way publish entry point.
//!
//! CI (or a local `oxyc publish`) uploads a gzipped tar of the built
//! bundle. The service validates it, stores each file in S3 under a
//! per-build prefix ([`super::custom_apps_build_store`]), records an
//! `app_builds` row, upserts the `apps` row (creating it on first
//! publish), and points the draft channel (and published, with
//! `--promote`) at the new build. Replaces the old
//! `ensure` + `aws s3 sync` + callback-`/sync` dance.
//!
//! Gating: this route is deliberately **not** app-admin-gated — partners and CI
//! publish through it — so [`authorize_publish`] IS the whole decision (never
//! assume the caller is trusted staff). It resolves the caller to a
//! [`custom_apps_publish_authz::PublishActor`] and defers to the pure, tested
//! `publish_decision`: staff may publish unless the workspace locked Oxy out
//! (`workspace_oxy_lockdown`); an org **Admin+** may publish their own app; a
//! **partner** needs all three gates (assigned + `manage_apps` + client consent);
//! a plain Member and an Outsider are **denied**. We also validate that the target
//! project belongs to the named org to catch fat-finger cross-org publishes.
