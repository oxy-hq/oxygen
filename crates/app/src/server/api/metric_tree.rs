//! Metric Tree API — tree structure and analysis ops over the semantic model.
//!
//! The tree is built per request from the workspace's semantic model, resolved
//! through the same scan source `execute_semantic_query` uses —
//! [`resolve_query_scan_source`]: the compile boundary first, the working copy
//! second. Every route here is `FleetOk`, so reading the working copy directly
//! is not an option: a stateless serve replica has none, and scanning the
//! missing directory failed every call with a flat 500 (oxy-hq/oxygen#878).
//!
//! The pure ops — tree, `sensitivity`, `predict` — need no database access.
//! The query-executing ops (`explain`, `opportunity`) run airlayer's
//! algorithms against a `QueryExecutor` bridged to Oxy's connector: airlayer
//! compiles each `QueryRequest` to SQL, and `run_via_agentic_connector`
//! executes it.
