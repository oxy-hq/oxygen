//! `GET /api/customer-apps/{org}/{app}/health` — external liveness for one
//! published custom app.
//!
//! ## Why this exists, and why it is not the bare `/health` you wanted
//!
//! A custom-app subdomain answers **200 with the SPA shell for every path and
//! every hostname**, including hostnames with no app behind them. Measured on
//! prod: `poke-house-staging--command-center…/`, a made-up
//! `nonexistent-canary-xyz…/`, and `app.oxygen-hq.com/` all return the same
//! 6137-byte HTML, and `/health`, `/live`, `/ready`, `/readyz` return it too.
//!
//! Two consequences shape this module:
//!
//! 1. **A monitor pointed at a bare `/health` on the subdomain would be green
//!    forever**, whatever the app's real state, because the fall-through shell
//!    is indistinguishable from a healthy answer — there is no string in it that
//!    a passing response could own. So this endpoint lives under `/api/*`, the
//!    only prefix `custom_apps_host_dispatch::subdomain_rewrite_middleware`
//!    leaves unrewritten, and returns JSON.
//! 2. **The body must be unambiguous under substring matching.** The verdict key
//!    is `oxy_app_health`, which cannot occur in the SPA shell, and its values
//!    are `pass` / `fail` — deliberately *not* `healthy` / `unhealthy`, where a
//!    monitor configured with `Contains "healthy"` silently matches the failure
//!    body. Neither value is a substring of the other, so even a sloppy
//!    contains-check is correct here.
//!
//! ## The contract a monitor should be configured against
//!
//! **`200` means pass. Every other status means fail** — including `401`, `403`,
//! `404` and `500`, which are auth/lookup outcomes rather than app verdicts.
//! Every one of those bodies also carries `"oxy_app_health":"fail"`, so a
//! body-matching monitor and a status-matching monitor agree on all paths.
//!
//! Do **not** configure a monitor to expect only `200`-or-`503`. That was the
//! first draft of this doc and it was wrong: the auth helper can answer before a
//! verdict is ever computed.
//!
//! ## Auth: a token, always
//!
//! Every request authenticates ([`authenticate_and_authorize`] — session cookie
//! or bearer token) *before* the app is looked up, so an unauthenticated caller
//! gets `401` whether or not the app exists. That ordering is the point: today
//! every subdomain returns an identical 200, so nothing distinguishes a real app
//! from a typo, and a health endpoint necessarily could. Requiring the token
//! first means this ships without adding an anonymous enumeration oracle.
//!
//! Two limits worth stating plainly rather than implying:
//!
//! - **Authenticated callers can still distinguish existence across orgs.** With
//!   any valid token, `403` (the app exists, you may not see it) and `404` (no
//!   such org/app) are different answers. That is inherited from the shared gate
//!   — `/debug` behaves the same — not introduced here, but the non-enumeration
//!   claim above is about anonymous callers only.
//! - **A non-staff token cannot see the `published` failure.**
//!   `user_can_access_app` gates the customer path on `published_at.is_some()`,
//!   so for an org-member token an *unpublished* app returns `403`, not a
//!   `published: fail` verdict. The alarm still fires — the body says `fail` —
//!   but the diagnosis reads "not permitted" when the real cause is "never
//!   promoted". The `403` detail says so, and a staff-scoped token tells the two
//!   apart. This is deliberate: re-deriving access here to dodge it would mean a
//!   second copy of the rule `Ring::AppAccess` owns.
//!
//! ## Not a Kubernetes probe
//!
//! Same rule as `healthcheck.rs`, for the same reason: `/health` there returns
//! 503 when Postgres is unreachable, and wiring that to a `livenessProbe` gave
//! oxy-prod a crash loop layered on top of a database incident (2026-08-11).
//! This endpoint reports on an *app*, not on the process serving it — a 503 here
//! means "that app is not serving", never "restart me".
//!
//! ## Fleet posture
//!
//! Postgres reads (`apps`, `app_builds`) plus at most one build-store `HEAD`
//! → **FleetOk**,
//! which is the manifest default and is pinned by `custom_app_health_is_fleet_ok`
//! rather than by a manifest entry. Not incidental: a liveness endpoint routed to
//! the ide singleton would report failure every time that singleton restarted,
//! which is precisely backwards. (The build store falls back to the state dir when
//! no bucket is configured, but that is the single-node dev path; hosted fleets
//! always have a bucket.)
