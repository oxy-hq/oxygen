//! V8-isolate execution for Oxy Functions.
//!
//! See `internal-docs/customer-apps-functions.md` §4 and
//! §11. Given a bundled function artifact (esbuild ESM output) and a `ctx`
//! payload, run `export default async (req, ctx) => Response` to completion
//! and return the resulting status/body.
//!
//! ## Why a dedicated thread + channel broker
//!
//! `deno_core::JsRuntime` owns a V8 isolate and is `!Send` — it cannot be
//! held across `.await` in the `Send` axum handler future, nor moved between
//! tokio workers. So the isolate runs on its **own OS thread** with a
//! current-thread tokio runtime, and every `ctx.*` host call is bridged to
//! the async host side (DB connectors, outbound fetch) over an mpsc channel.
//! The handler future only ever holds channel endpoints + a join handle, all
//! of which are `Send`.
//!
//! ```text
//!   handler (Send)            isolate thread (!Send)
//!   ─────────────             ──────────────────────
//!   broker loop  <── HostCall ── op_ctx_query / op_ctx_fetch
//!        │  host.query(sql).await
//!        └────────── oneshot reply ─────────►  resolves the JS promise
//! ```
//!
//! `ctx.semantic.query` (airlayer), `ctx.airway.run` (Airway runner), and
//! `ctx.warehouse.{insert,exec,upsert}` (project-database allowlist, §11.3)
//! are all wired to real backends.
//!
//! `ctx.tx` adds multi-statement atomicity over that same allowlist: the
//! isolate holds only a handle id, the pinned connection lives in the host's
//! `tx::TxRegistry`, and the bootstrap wrapper owns the commit/rollback
//! bracket so an author cannot leave one open. `ctx.queryStream` (§11.5) fetches up to
//! `FUNCTION_STREAM_MAX_ROWS` rows in one host call and yields them to the
//! function as an async generator in client-side batches — a pragmatic MVP
//! pending a true warehouse-cursor implementation.
