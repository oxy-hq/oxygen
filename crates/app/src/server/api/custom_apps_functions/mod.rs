//! `POST /customer-apps/<org>/<slug>/fn/<name>` — Oxy Functions route
//! invocation.
//!
//! See `internal-docs/customer-apps-functions.md`. This
//! handler covers the **route** invocation mode (§2); schedule and Airway
//! triggers reuse [`crate::server::api::custom_apps_functions::runtime::run`]
//! from their own call sites and are not wired here.
//!
//! **Three run concepts, easy to conflate** (see the "Run concepts" section of
//! `internal-docs/customer-apps-functions.md`): the **V8 isolate
//! run** (`runtime::run`) is the raw JS execution; an **invocation**
//! (`app_function_invocations`, `mode`) is the audit row for *every* run —
//! including a plain request-time **route** call; a **job** (`agentic_runs`,
//! `source_type="app_function"`) is the *durable, orchestrated, monitored*
//! background run (schedule/manual) that also produces an invocation. A route
//! call is an invocation only — no durable run, not in the coordinator. A job
//! runs the SAME isolate, wrapped in the queue/monitoring/trigger machinery.
