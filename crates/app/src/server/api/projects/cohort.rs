//! `/api/projects/{project_id}/semantic/cohort` — peer-cohort comparison for
//! customer-app bundles.
//!
//! Sibling of [`super::metric_tree`]: same customer-app gate, same
//! compile-boundary layer load, same `route_fleet` mount. Where the metric
//! tree decomposes ONE subject over time, this compares MANY subjects against
//! each other at a point in time — airlayer's `engine::cohort`, added in
//! airlayer PR #116.
//!
//! Three contracts this module exists to preserve, all of which are easy to
//! break by "tidying" the response:
//!
//!  1. **`excluded` is not optional detail.** A subject that cannot be
//!     compared comes back with a reason. The feature exists partly because in
//!     the hand-rolled predecessor a store "simply did not appear in the list
//!     and no screen said why".
//!  2. **`min_peers` is a reporting predicate, never a filter.** A subject
//!     below the floor is returned with its comparison computed and
//!     `sufficient: false`. Filtering it here would relocate a product
//!     decision into the transport layer.
//!  3. **The cohort name and band window are echoed back**, so a UI rendering
//!     them cannot drift from the query that produced the numbers.
