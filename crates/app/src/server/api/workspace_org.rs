//! THE "is this workspace a live workspace of this org?" predicate.
//!
//! Three call sites ask exactly this question, and each used to carry its own
//! copy of the `match`:
//!
//! - `custom_apps_publish::validate_project` — the cross-org guard on publish.
//!   Anything but [`WorkspaceOrgMatch::InOrg`] is
//!   `PublishError::UnknownProject`.
//! - `custom_apps_publish::ensure_same_workspace` — decides whether a publish
//!   may re-home an app. Anything but `InOrg` means the app's *current*
//!   workspace is not a live workspace of its org, so the re-home is allowed;
//!   `InOrg` is `PublishError::ProjectMismatch`.
//! - `admin::apps::ops::ensure_workspace_in_org` — the data-integrity rule on
//!   the admin create/move endpoints. All three failures share one **422** body
//!   and differ only in the logged `reason`.
//!
//! **Each caller keeps its own error mapping; only the decision is shared.**
//! The error types genuinely differ — `ApiErr` (a 422 with a JSON body) vs
//! `PublishError::UnknownProject` vs `PublishError::ProjectMismatch` — and two
//! of the three deliberately collapse the failure variants while the admin one
//! tells them apart in its log line. Folding the mapping in here would force
//! one of those shapes onto all three.
//!
//! What this module buys is that the *predicate* cannot drift. If one side
//! later starts accepting `org_id.is_none()`, or starts filtering on
//! `WorkspaceStatus`, it changes here and all three move together. Kept apart,
//! they would diverge silently and publish and the admin API would disagree
//! about the same row.
//!
//! **`WorkspaceStatus` is deliberately NOT consulted today.** A `Cloning`,
//! `Failed` or `NotOxyProject` workspace counts as in-org, exactly as it did
//! before this module existed. That is a preserved behaviour, not an
//! endorsement — when the rule changes, [`classify`] is the one place it lands.
//!
//! Not to be folded in: `custom_apps_publish::org_for_project` answers the
//! opposite question. It *derives* the org from a workspace when the publisher
//! named none, so it has no `org_id` to compare against and no notion of a
//! mismatch — only "unknown" and "orphaned", which it reports as two distinct
//! `UnknownProject` messages.
