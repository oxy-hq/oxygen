//! Frontline sign-in — the HTTP surface a kiosk talks to.
//!
//! `oxy_auth::frontline` decides whether a PIN is right. This decides what that
//! is worth: a session, scoped and short, that lets a worker be somebody for
//! the length of a shift.
//!
//! # Why these routes are public, and what stands in for auth
//!
//! A worker has nothing to authenticate WITH until they have signed in, so both
//! routes below sit in the public router. That makes rate limiting load-bearing
//! rather than defensive, and it is layered:
//!
//! * the credential itself throttles and locks out per `(org, identifier)`
//!   ([`oxy_auth::frontline::verify_pin`]);
//! * this module throttles per **org** as well, because the credential-level
//!   lockout is per worker and a caller walking a roster of 40 names gets 40
//!   separate budgets;
//! * every failure returns one response, so neither layer leaks which of the
//!   two refused.
//!
//! # Fleet role
//!
//! Both routes are `route_fleet`, and must be. They read and write Postgres and
//! touch no working copy, no `.git` and no state dir — and more to the point,
//! **signing in has to survive the ide restarting**. Pinning login to the
//! singleton would mean a deploy locks every store out of its own checklists.
