/// `assets/`. HTML and unfingerprinted root files must revalidate so a new
/// deployment is picked up immediately.
///
/// ## Why HTML is `private`, not just `no-cache`
///
/// `no-cache` means "store, but revalidate before reuse" — it does **not**
/// stop a *shared* cache from storing the response. HTML responses from this
/// handler carry a per-visitor tracking `Set-Cookie`
/// (`custom_apps_tracking::session_id_for_serve`, stamped in `serve_pretty`),
/// so a shared cache that stored one would hand **every** later visitor the
/// same session id and silently collapse the Activity tab's numbers into a
/// single session.
///
/// `private` is what forbids that, and it is *a* precondition for ever
/// putting a CDN in front of this route — the "web-cache-deception" risk
/// named in `internal-docs/customer-apps-performance.md`. The HTML *body* is
/// in fact identical for every viewer of an app (`window.__OXY_APP__` holds
/// app-level identity only, never user identity); it is the cookie on the
/// response, not the bytes, that makes it unshareable.
///
/// ## What this does NOT cover: `public` on bundle bytes
///
/// Non-HTML responses still leave as `public`, while the route enforces
/// **per-app** visibility — `app.is_restricted()` means org membership alone
/// isn't enough (`custom_apps_auth`). A CDN or corporate proxy will therefore
/// store a restricted app's JS and re-serve it to anyone holding the URL,
/// with the member list never consulted. What stands between a restricted
/// bundle and a stranger today is that content-hashed filenames are
/// discoverable only from the (now `private`) HTML — obscurity, not the
/// authz gate.
///
/// That is a deliberate current position, not an oversight: bundle bytes are
/// treated as non-secret. Deriving the `public`/`private` half from the app's
/// visibility is the fix if that ever stops being true, and it costs
/// restricted apps their shared-cache hit. Read "precondition" above as
/// necessary, not sufficient.
///
/// ## Why the resolved file decides before the requested prefix
///
/// The prefix rule reads the **requested** path but the HTML test reads the
/// **resolved** one, and the SPA fallback makes those diverge: a miss on
/// `assets/index-abc123.js` resolves to `index.html`. Applying the prefix
/// rule first would return an HTML body under `public, immutable`, and since
/// Vite hashes by content, a later build shipping that same chunk would find
/// the browser (or CDN) holding a year-long HTML entry at a module-script
/// URL — a white screen with no server-side remedy. An HTML body therefore
/// never leaves here cacheable, whatever URL reached it.
///
/// ## `?v=` — a version pin, honoured only for the build actually served
///
/// A bundle-root file is unfingerprinted, so its bare URL gets five minutes
/// and no more: longer would show a stale file after a publish. The launcher's
/// icon and art are such files and it renders them on every visit, so past
/// five minutes every card image paid a round trip plus the auth gate.
/// `workspace_custom_apps::icon_art_urls` therefore appends
/// `?v=<published build pk>` — one URL per publish — and a URL that names
/// its build can be cached forever.
///
/// It is honoured **only when `v` equals the build this request is serving**
/// (`VersionPin::served`), never merely because it parses. App resolution —
/// which carries the build pointers — is cached per process for
/// `custom_apps_cache::CACHE_TTL` (60s). For up to that long after a publish,
/// a pod that has not seen it still resolves the app to the PREVIOUS build,
/// while the launcher list, read fresh on another pod, already hands the
/// browser `icon.svg?v=<new>`. That pod serves the old bytes under the new
/// URL. Were that response `immutable`, the browser would pin the old icon
/// under the new build's URL for a year, with no server-side remedy: the URL
/// does not change again until the next publish. On a mismatch the response
/// keeps the ordinary five-minute policy — the staleness a bare URL already
/// accepts — and the first render after it expires fetches the right bytes. A
/// staff draft preview (draft bytes under a published-build `v`) is the same
/// mismatch and gets the same answer.
///
/// The pin is checked after both guards above and after the hashed-prefix
/// rule, and it only ever upgrades `max-age=300`: it cannot make HTML or a
/// platform object cacheable, and a `v` naming another build cannot demote a
/// hashed asset. The service worker deliberately does not share this case —
