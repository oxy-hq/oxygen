//! The storage sweeper: periodically re-measures each app's silo into
//! `app_storage_usage`, appends a sample, and prunes the sample history.
//!
//! ## Cadence, and why it is tiered
//!
//! Measuring costs one LIST per 1,000 objects, so the cost tracks object count,
//! not value. Apps are picked **oldest-measured-first** and only a bounded batch
//! runs per tick, which gives small apps a fast refresh and large ones a slower
//! one without needing a scheduler that understands sizes.
//!
//! Vercel Blob snapshots every 15 minutes and averages into GB-month. That is the
//! ceiling to aim at, not the starting point: Supabase ships a 1–4 hour lag
//! without complaint, and an hourly sample averages into a defensible GB-month.
//!
//! ## Why not a `TaskSpec`
//!
//! `oxy-task-spec-default` exists so long-running work survives instance death
//! and isn't a spawn in an HTTP handler. This is neither: it is a fixed-cost
//! periodic maintenance loop with no per-request trigger and nothing to resume —
//! a missed tick is simply picked up by the next one, because the work is
//! idempotent by construction (it recomputes from S3). It follows
//! `automation_run::spawn_periodic_sweep`, the established shape for exactly this.
//! If per-app measurement ever needs to fan out across the worker fleet, THAT is
//! the point to make it a queued task.
