/// Admin routes. The outer nest layer in `router::global` is the **door**
/// (`oxy_owner_or_app_admin_guard`): it answers "are you Oxy staff at all". Each
/// sub-router below then escalates to the capability its surface is actually about,
/// via `route_layer` — the inner layer runs after the outer one, so a request that
/// passed the door still gets a 403 here without the capability.
///
/// That per-section escalation is not new machinery: `billing` and `app_admins` have
/// always escalated to strict OXY_OWNER this way. What changed is that the *rest* of
/// the console used to escalate to nothing, so any staff standing reached all of it —
/// which is why an app publisher had the same authority as someone entitled to delete
/// a tenant. `require(Action::Platform*)` generalises the pattern that was already here.
///
/// One gate remains owner-only rather than capability-gated, deliberately:
/// * `billing` — the Billing queue, `Ring::GlobalOwnerOnly`.
///
/// `app_admins` — the **grant table itself** — used to be the second, on the reasoning
/// that "a capability that could edit the grant table would let its holder widen their
/// own grant, and the ceiling would mean nothing". That objection is real and is
/// answered by bounding the write rather than withholding the capability: `may_delegate`
/// admits only a grant strictly weaker than the writer's own, so the one row a holder
/// can never touch is their own, and only the owner can mint a peer. See
/// `admin::delegation`. **The capability gate here is a door, not the control** — the
/// handlers carry the row-level half (`actor_facts` once, then `refuse(may_delegate(..))`
/// per row), exactly as scope works.
///
/// **Scope is not enforced here** — see `platform_cap_guard`. A scoped operator passes
/// these gates and the handler filters its rows.
///
/// `airway_config` is deliberately *not* a third owner-only gate: it is deployment-wide
/// operational config, so it takes `Action::PlatformOperate` beside `workspace_health` /
/// `routing` / `metrics`. The two exceptions above are exceptions for reasons that do not
/// apply to it — billing is `Ring::GlobalOwnerOnly`, and `app_admins` is the grant table
/// itself, where a capability could widen its own holder.
///
/// `internal_jobs::router()` is mounted separately at `/admin/internal-jobs`
/// in `router::global` because its routes were flattened during the
