//! App-scoped secret management — the write path for `apps/<app_id>/<KEY>`, and
//! the reconciled view that says which keys an app is still missing.
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! `ctx.env` has always read secrets named `apps/<app_id>/<KEY>` out of the
//! project secret manager, but nothing could **create** one. The public secrets
//! API and the settings UI both reject `/` in a name (`validate_secret_name`),
//! so the only writer was `ctx.secrets.set` from inside a function — which
//! cannot bootstrap the secret the function needs in order to run. A `webhook:`
//! block was the sharpest form of it: 401 on every delivery, and no way to set
//! the signing key it named. (The docs told people to use Settings → Secrets;
//! that never worked.)
//!
//! Everything *else* about an app-scoped secret already worked through the
//! existing `/api/workspaces/{id}/secrets` routes, because those address by row
//! id rather than by name — list, reveal, rotate and delete all resolve fine.
//! So this module is deliberately narrow: it owns creation, and it owns the
//! app-shaped *view* (bare keys, grouped under one app, reconciled against what
//! the build declares) that made the raw `apps/<uuid>/KEY` rows unreadable.
//!
//! # Mounts
//!
//! One handler set, two mounts, each keeping the guard already on its surface:
//!
//! | Mount | Guard |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | `/api/customer-apps/{id}/secrets` | owner **or** app-admin, beside `/{id}/publish` |
//! | `/api/workspaces/{ws}/custom-apps/{app_id}/secrets` (POST only) | `WorkspaceAdmin` |
//!
//! No `/admin/apps/{id}/secrets` twin: `/customer-apps` is already reachable by
//! owners as well as app-admins (`oxy_owner_or_app_admin_guard`), and it is the
//! surface the staff console actually calls for app work — publish, builds,
//! functions, storage. A second mount would add a route, not reach.
//!
//! The staff mount reaches any app by id, exactly as the rest of that surface
//! does. **The workspace mount must not** — see [`scoped_to_workspace`].
//!
//! All of it is Postgres-only (no workspace FS, no git), so every route is
//! `FleetOk`.
