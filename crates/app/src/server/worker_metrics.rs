//! Prometheus exposition for the `oxy worker` process.
//!
//! Single endpoint, `GET /metrics`, mounted on the same tiny health
//! server that already exposes `/healthz` and `/readyz`. The format
//! is the documented Prometheus text exposition; we hand-roll it to
//! avoid pulling in a heavyweight client crate for a set this small.
//!
//! What gets exposed:
//!
//! | Metric | Type | Labels | Source |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | `oxy_queue_depth_queued` | gauge | `task_kind` | `agentic_task_queue` GROUP BY |
//! | `oxy_queue_depth_claimed` | gauge | `task_kind` | same |
//! | `oxy_queue_depth_dead` | gauge | `task_kind` | same |
//! | `oxy_worker_capacity` | gauge | `task_kind` | one global env cap, per label |
//! | `oxy_worker_info` | gauge=1 | `worker_id`, `version` | identity |
//! | `oxy_compile_stuck_compiling` | gauge | (none) | `revisions` compile-health query |
//! | `oxy_compile_promotion_lag` | gauge | (none) | `revisions` ⋈ `workspaces` |
//! | `oxy_tasks_requeued_total` | counter | (none) | `agentic_runtime::crud::TASKS_REQUEUED` |
//! | `oxy_tasks_dead_lettered_total` | counter | (none) | `agentic_runtime::crud::TASKS_DEAD_LETTERED` |
//! | `oxy_router_probes_received_total` | counter | (none) | `agentic_runtime::router::PROBES_RECEIVED` |
//! | `oxy_router_last_probe_received_timestamp_seconds` | gauge | (none) | `agentic_runtime::router::LAST_PROBE_RECEIVED_MILLIS` |
//! | `oxy_abandoned_isolates_total` | counter | (none) | `custom_apps_functions::runtime::abandoned_isolates` |
//! | `oxy_metrics_scrape_db_ok` | gauge=0/1 | (none) | this replica's DB read status this scrape |
//!
//! The queue-depth rows group by the task's kind, which `agentic_task_queue`
//! stores only inside its `spec` JSONB — that table has no `source_type`
//! column (that one is on `agentic_runs`). See [`read_queue_depth`].
//!
//! Per-process inflight counters (current concurrent tasks per
//! worker) aren't surfaced yet because the orchestrator doesn't
//! expose them out of the box; they'll land alongside `claimed_by`
//! observability (refinement E of the scaling design). Scrapers
//! should derive in-flight from `oxy_queue_depth_claimed` meanwhile
//! (`max` across replicas, then summed across `task_kind`) — with the
//! same absent-vs-zero caveat the queue-depth gauges carry below: it
//! comes off the same folded map, so an idle fleet emits no series at
//! all and a panel reads "no data" rather than 0.
//!
//! Both uses aggregate this gauge identically — `max` across replicas,
//! then `sum` across `task_kind`. There is no second rule for the HPA
//! numerator. The only per-kind constraint in that query is on the
//! DENOMINATOR: `oxy_worker_capacity` must carry exactly one `task_kind`
//! label, because summing its three is the 3x trap below.
//!
//! Aggregation splits on the table's `Source` column, not on metric
//! type, and the replica and `task_kind` axes don't always agree.
//! DB-sourced gauges are identical on every replica — take `max`;
//! summing multiplies the backlog by replica count. Process-local ones
//! (`oxy_worker_capacity`, `oxy_worker_info`, both `*_total` counters)
//! take `sum` across replicas — but capacity does *not* sum across
//! `task_kind`: `ConcurrencyCaps::from_env` emits one global pool under
//! all three labels, so adding them reports 3× the real headroom. Pick a
//! single label.
//!
//! `oxy_metrics_scrape_db_ok` belongs to NEITHER bucket, despite reading
//! the DB: `db_error` is computed from this process's own two queries,
//! so the gauge is per-replica. Aggregate with `min`. Alerting takes
//! THREE matchers for three disjoint failures — they are not
//! alternatives:
//!
//! ```text
//! up{job="oxy-worker"} == 0            one replica's scrape hung or
//!                                      failed. PRIMARY — the only
//!                                      per-target matcher. Give it a
//!                                      for: 2m, so one slow or missed
//!                                      scrape does not page; real
//!                                      starvation persists across
//!                                      several.
//! <gauge>{job="oxy-worker"} == 0       scrape returned, DB read failed.
//! absent(<gauge>{job="oxy-worker"})    TOTAL loss — every target gone
//!                                      or discovery broke, which
//!                                      up == 0 cannot catch because
//!                                      there are no up series either.
//! ```
//!
//! `job` comes from your scrape config — substitute whatever labels it.
//!
//! `absent()` alone is NOT enough: it fires only when the selector
//! matches nothing, so one starved replica among ten leaves nine series
//! and it stays quiet — the same partial-blindness defect `max` is
//! rejected for below. Always scope the selector: unscoped, a staging
//! fleet in the same Prometheus keeps the vector non-empty forever.
//! `max` is the one aggregation that must not be used — it returns 1
//! while any single replica can still reach Postgres, so the alert goes
//! quiet exactly when part of the fleet has gone blind, and this is the
//! alert called load-bearing below.
//!
//! The HPA reads outstanding work — `oxy_queue_depth_queued` PLUS
//! `oxy_queue_depth_claimed`, summed across kinds — against
//! `oxy_worker_capacity`, so each of those mistakes mis-sizes the
//! fleet: `sum` across replicas inflates the backlog N×, `max` across
//! replicas hides all but one replica's headroom, and summing capacity's
//! labels reports 3× the pool — which under-scales precisely under load.
//! NOT a per-kind ratio: capacity is ONE shared semaphore per process
//! (see `from_env`), so dividing one kind's work by it double-books the
//! pool. Sum the numerator across kinds and keep a single capacity label
//! as the pool size; the recipe is in `internal-docs/worker-fleet.md`.
//! Alert recipes for the DB-sourced gauges: "What to watch" in
//! `internal-docs/compile-boundary.md`, the operator runbook.
//!
//! Failure mode: if the DB read errors, we emit the in-process
//! metrics anyway and surface scrape health via the separate
//! `oxy_metrics_scrape_db_ok` gauge (1 = ok, 0 = the DB read failed
//! this scrape). We never fail the scrape, so the in-process counters
//! still export. Be precise about what the HPA then sees, though: the
//! queue-depth series go *absent*, which is not the same as reading
//! zero. An absent series usually leaves the HPA unable to compute the
//! metric, so it holds replicas rather than scaling down — safe, but
//! not "correct" in any stronger sense. Idle and DB-broken are both
//! absence and cannot be told apart from these series alone, which is
//! what makes alerting on `oxy_metrics_scrape_db_ok` load-bearing
//! rather than nice-to-have.

/// receipt. A healthy pipeline therefore ticks continuously; a pipeline
/// where Postgres has silently stopped delivering notifications goes
/// quiet while the connection still answers `SELECT 1`. That silent
/// stall is the failure this pair exists to catch, and it is the reason
/// the signal has to be a *timestamp* rather than a rate: the question
/// is "how long since the last one", not "how many".
///
/// Both are process-local, so they carry the same replica caveat as the
/// reap counters above — and one more besides. This endpoint is mounted
/// only on the worker health server (`worker_health`), but
/// `background::start` runs a router in every `oxy serve` and `oxy ide`
/// process too. Those replicas receive probes that nothing scrapes.
/// That is acceptable rather than merely tolerated: the worker's claim
/// loop is the thing whose latency actually depends on NOTIFY delivery,
/// so the fleet that matters is the fleet that is covered. A serve-only
/// stall shows up as claim latency, not as a missing wake.
///
/// **The gauge is absent, never zero, before the first probe.**
/// `background::start` deliberately lets one full interval elapse
/// before the first emission, so a freshly started pod has legitimately
/// seen nothing. Emitting `0` there would make `time() - gauge` read as
/// ~57 years and page every rollout. Alerting therefore takes THREE
/// matchers for three disjoint failures, exactly as
/// `oxy_metrics_scrape_db_ok` above documents for its own:
///
/// ```text
/// (time() - oxy_router_last_probe_received_timestamp_seconds{job="oxy-worker"}) > 300
///     delivery has STOPPED. Three missed 60s probes, with a for: 5m.
///     Per-target, and the primary matcher.
/// oxy_router_probes_received_total{job="oxy-worker"} == 0
///     this replica has never received one, while its peers are fine.
///     Per-target, for: 15m.
/// absent(oxy_router_last_probe_received_timestamp_seconds{job="oxy-worker"})
///     TOTAL loss — every target gone, or discovery broke, which the
///     other two cannot catch because there are no series to evaluate.
/// ```
///
/// **The counter is what makes the per-replica check possible, and it is
/// not optional corroboration.** `absent()` is quiet whenever *any*
/// replica reports, so on its own it catches a never-delivering pod only
/// if the whole fleet is dead — one bad pod among healthy peers emits no
/// gauge series at all, leaving staleness with nothing to evaluate and
/// `absent()` masked by its neighbours. That is the same partial-blindness
/// defect `internal-docs/worker-fleet.md` names for
/// `oxy_metrics_scrape_db_ok`, and the reason `oxy_router_probes_received_total`
/// is exported unconditionally at `0`: a per-target `== 0` is a real
/// series to match on, where a missing gauge is not.
///
/// For capacity rather than alerting, `rate()` over the counter should sit
/// at roughly (peer count / 60) per second, and a step change means
/// instances joined or left rather than that delivery broke. Aggregate
/// with `sum` across replicas, like the other process-local counters.
///
/// This replaced a per-receipt `info` log line. See
/// `agentic_runtime::router::PROBES_RECEIVED` for that history — the
/// short version is that the line cost 67% of prod's entire oxy log
/// volume and landed in a store that carries no alerts.
///
