//! Partner + multi-tenant seed data — realistic orgs, generated people,
//! partnerships and workspaces so a developer can immediately exercise the admin
//! surface and the partner console. **Folded into `oxy seed`** (no `--partners`
//! flag); silently skipped on a non-local DB.
//!
//! The seed IS the design's demo (see
//! `internal-docs/partner-platform.md`). It proves two things
//! the old seed structurally could not:
//!
//! 1. **A partner is a real org.** Acme Consulting has its own owner, its own
//!    workspace, and — with 6 members but only 5 operator slots — an employee who
//!    holds **no partner role at all**, just using Acme's own Oxy. The partner is
//!    not a management shell.
//!
//! 2. **Access is one thing, bounded by the ceiling.** Acme's operators each reach
//!    every client Acme manages and can do everything Acme's ceiling allows — no
//!    per-person roles, no per-client scopes. Initech shows the ceiling rule: its
//!    operators get only `manage_apps` + `view_audit`, so that is all any of them
//!    can do — not manage members, query data, or onboard clients.
//!
//! People (name + email) are GENERATED from curated pools, deterministically, so
//! the data is convincing AND reproducible. Deterministic UUID v5 ids + check-
//! first inserts make the whole seed idempotent and test-referenceable.
//!
//! Dev/test only — refuses a non-local `OXY_DATABASE_URL` for the destructive
//! `--clear`, and skips the partner seed for a non-local `oxy seed`.
