//! Concrete `MetricTreeRunner` for Oxy.
//!
//! Loads the workspace's semantic model from disk, compiles airlayer
//! `QueryRequest`s through `SemanticEngine`, and executes the resulting SQL
//! through Oxy's connector pool. Used by both the HTTP `/semantic/metric-tree`
//! handlers and the agentic analytics tools — same code path, identical
//! resolution semantics.
//!
//! Per-run cost notes (see `metric-tree.md` for the algorithmic context): a
//! single `explain` call can fire 100+ queries against the warehouse. Each
//! query goes through `Handle::block_on` because airlayer's `QueryExecutor`
//! type is synchronous; the wrapping `spawn_blocking` is provided by the
//! caller (HTTP handler) so the runtime thread isn't blocked.
