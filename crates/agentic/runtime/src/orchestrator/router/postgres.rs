//! Postgres-backed [`TaskRouter`] using `LISTEN` / `NOTIFY`.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! - One **dedicated `tokio_postgres` connection** per process, separate
//!   from the SeaORM pool, running `LISTEN oxy_task_enqueued`. `LISTEN`
//!   is per-connection in Postgres, so a pooled connection that rotates
//!   would be unreliable.
//! - A long-lived **driver task** owns that connection. It pumps the
//!   `tokio_postgres::Connection` future (required for the client to
//!   work at all) and observes `AsyncMessage::Notification` events,
//!   which it translates into wakes on a shared `tokio::sync::Notify`.
//! - `wait_for_task` callers race a `notify.notified()` future against
//!   their own timeout. Spurious wakes are fine — the caller's job is
//!   to call `claim_task` and find out.
//! - `notify_enqueued` issues `SELECT pg_notify(...)` through a
//!   *separate* pooled connection (the SeaORM `DatabaseConnection`),
//!   so it composes with whatever transaction the caller is in. Postgres
//!   defers NOTIFY delivery until the issuing txn commits, so even if a
//!   caller commits *after* our `notify_enqueued`, listeners won't see
//!   a wake before the row is visible.
//!
//! ## Reconnection
//!
//! If the listener connection drops (server failover, OS network
//! reset, slow-query timeout), the driver task backs off and reconnects.
//! On reconnect it fires the local `Notify` once so any waiting worker
//! does a catch-up `claim_task` — this covers the window during which
//! notifications could have been missed.
//!
//! ## Credentials & the factory pattern
//!
//! Connection parameters arrive through a [`ListenerConfigFactory`]
//! closure that the reconnect loop calls *every iteration*. The
//! returned [`tokio_postgres::Config`] is consumed immediately for the
//! connect attempt. For password auth this closure trivially returns
//! the same parsed `Config`. For RDS IAM auth it mints a fresh SigV4
//! token and builds a `Config` with that token in the password slot.
//!
//! Important property: once the listener connection authenticates,
//! the token's TTL is moot — Postgres doesn't re-auth mid-stream. A
//! listener authed at t=0 with a 15-minute IAM token stays valid at
//! t=24h. We only need a fresh token at the *next reconnect*. That's
//! why this file has no background refresh loop: the reconnect path
//! already calls the factory at exactly the right moment.
//!
//! ## TLS
//!
//! Built once at construction via [`build_rustls_connector`] and
//! shared across every reconnect. The actual TLS handshake fires only
//! when the server offers it *and* the [`tokio_postgres::Config::ssl_mode`]
//! permits it — `Disable` skips it entirely, `Prefer` falls back to plain
//! on a plain-TCP server, `Require` insists on TLS.
//!
//! Certificate *verification* strictness is a separate axis, set by
//! [`TlsVerification`] and threaded in through
//! [`PostgresTaskRouterOptions`]. It must match the connection pool's
//! `OXY_DATABASE_SSL_MODE` handling: under `require` the pool encrypts
//! without validating the certificate, so the listener does the same
//! ([`TlsVerification::RequireNoVerify`]). Diverging here is what made
//! the listener's handshake fail against AWS RDS (Amazon RDS CA) and
//! in-cluster CloudNativePG (self-signed CA) while the pool connected
//! fine — neither CA is in the Mozilla `webpki-roots` bundle.
//!
//! ## What we deliberately don't do
//!
//! - **No per-class channels yet.** A single channel + ignored class
//!   filter keeps the wire protocol simple. When worker classes land,
//!   only this file changes — the trait and callers are already
//!   class-aware.
//! - **No payload data.** NOTIFY is "go look", not "here's your task."
//!   Storage is the source of truth.
//! - **No notification deduplication.** Postgres may deliver multiple
//!   NOTIFYs back-to-back; we wake once per notification and let
//!   `SKIP LOCKED` sort out the claim race.
