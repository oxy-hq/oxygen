        // delegated step that outlives 60s (airway pipelines, routinely).

        // the points where this process stops owning the claim (terminal
        // outcome, deferral, or a re-claim of the same `task_id`) — NOT the
        // heartbeat predicate going unsatisfied. Do not weaken that to "it
        // stops itself once the row is no longer ours": `worker_id` is
        // process-stable and `update_queue_heartbeat` carries no fencing
        // token, so after the resume path re-enqueues this `task_id` and this
        // same process re-claims it — typically within milliseconds, far
        // inside one tick — a stale ticker's predicate matches all over again
        // and it never stops.
        //
        // Process death still stops every ticker, so a genuinely abandoned
        // suspension goes stale, gets reaped, and reaches `find_stuck_runs`
