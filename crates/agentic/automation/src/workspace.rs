/// Why a workspace read failed, when the caller has to tell the two apart.
///
/// Three answers, because a read can fail three ways and they want three
/// statuses:
///
/// - `Missing` — not in the workspace. 404.
/// - `Invalid` — it IS here and does not parse. 422. A permanent condition;
///   calling it retryable tells a client to come back for a file that will
///   never load, and removes the only status that could say "your YAML is
///   broken".
/// - `Unavailable` — this node could not look. 503.
///
/// Reporting `Unavailable` as `Missing` tells a caller their automation does
/// not exist because a database blipped; reporting `Invalid` as `Unavailable`
/// tells them to retry a typo. The host must label by the SHAPE of the
/// failure, never by which call site produced it — the first version of this
/// inferred `Unavailable` from position and swept both other shapes into it.
