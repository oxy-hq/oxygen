//! Platform telemetry — what an **operator** of Oxy sees in ClickStack /
//! HyperDX: every `tracing` span and event this process emits, shipped over
//! OTLP to the cluster's OpenTelemetry collector, plus the structured log
//! format the container runtime captures from stderr.
//!
//! Not to be confused with `oxy-observability`, the **product** feature: that
//! crate's `SpanCollectorLayer` writes agent / automation spans into the
//! tenant-facing ClickHouse (`OXY_CLICKHOUSE_*`) that the in-app Traces console
//! reads. The two are different stores answering different questions, and they
//! are wired independently — a deployment can run either, both, or neither.
//!
//! One `tracing` subscriber, several sinks. `oxy-server`'s `logging` module
//! composes them; this crate owns the pieces:
//!
//! | Module          | What it provides                                                      |
//! |-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | [`otel`]        | The OTLP trace + log exporters as subscriber layers, and their shutdown |
//! | [`metrics`]     | The third signal: one instrument set behind a Prometheus reader and an opt-in OTLP one |
//! | [`resource`]    | Who is emitting: `service.name` per fleet role, version, environment  |
//! | [`json_format`] | The stderr JSON line: flat fields, `trace_id` / `span_id`, current span |
//! | [`http_trace`]  | One `SERVER` span per HTTP request, named by route, W3C parent honoured |
//! | [`http_metrics`] | RED metrics per request, sharing `http_trace`'s route source |
//! | [`propagation`] | `traceparent` injection for the internal serve → ide hop               |
//! | [`stderr_capture`] | Every stray stderr line (dependencies, C libs, panics) as JSON, repeats collapsed |
//! | [`sentry_filter`] | What reaches Sentry: `error` an event, `warn` a breadcrumb, custom-app targets and surfaces nothing |
//!
//! ## Configuration is the OpenTelemetry environment contract
//!
//! The context layer (ids on every span and log line, `traceparent` on the
//! internal hop) is on for every server-shaped process; `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED`
//! turns it off. Nothing *leaves* until `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (or a
//! per-signal `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` / `_LOGS_ENDPOINT`) is set —
//! the SDK's own `localhost:4318` default is deliberately *not* honoured, or a
//! laptop without a collector would log an export failure every five seconds.
//! From there the standard variables apply: `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`,
//! `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` (HyperDX Cloud's
//! `authorization`), `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER` / `_ARG`, `OTEL_BSP_*`,
//! `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED`, `OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER` (`none` switches traces off) and
//! `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER` (`otlp` switches logs *on* — opt-in, see `otel`). The
//! one Oxy-specific knob is
//! `OXY_OTEL_FILTER`, a `RUST_LOG`-style directive string that decides what is
//! *exported*, independent of what is *printed* (`OXY_LOG_LEVEL`).
//!
//! The full operator guide is `internal-docs/platform-telemetry.md`.
