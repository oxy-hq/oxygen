/**
 * The token cache — the SAME file the deleted Rust `oxy login` wrote.
 *
 * It began as interop with a program written in another language, and the
 * shape is still that contract: every login cached before `oxyc` took over
 * lives in this file, so the path, the host key and the field names were
 * transcribed from the Rust `login.rs` rather than chosen here. Change any of
 * them and every existing login silently disappears.
 *
 * THE PATH IS NOT `~/.config` ON macOS, whatever the Rust doc comment said.
 * `login.rs` built it from `dirs::config_dir()`, and that crate returns
 * `$HOME/Library/Application Support` on macOS — verified against a live
 * credentials file. A `~/.config/oxy` implementation would read an empty store
 * on every Mac in the company and report every developer as logged out.
 * `configDir()` reproduces the crate's platform rules, and
 * `credentials.test.ts` pins them.
