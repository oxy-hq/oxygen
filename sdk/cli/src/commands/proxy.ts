/**
 * `oxyc proxy` — local custom-app dev against a cloud Oxy.
 *
 * An OUTBOUND sidecar: it does not serve the app (your dev server does). It
 * listens on `--port` (default 3000, where a local `oxy serve` would be, so a
 * dev server's existing Oxy proxy target already matches) and forwards the Oxy
 * calls your dev server sends it — attaching the `oxyc login` bearer and
 * applying guardrails — to the resolved cloud target.
 *
 * It replaced the Rust `oxy proxy`, and the guardrails came across verbatim
 * rather than reinvented, because each one is a decision somebody argued and
 * every one of them is about not writing to a customer's production data from
 * a laptop:
 *
 *   - side-effecting calls are HELD by default (`--allow-writes` forwards)
 *   - tracking events are DROPPED by default (`--allow-events` forwards)
 *   - auth endpoints reach the backend UNAUTHENTICATED, so sign-in works
 *   - the dev token is a FALLBACK, never an override of a real browser session
 *   - `Set-Cookie` is rewritten so a cloud cookie is storable on localhost
 *   - a production target is refused without `--yes`
 *
 * An Oxy Function call also gets a W3C trace (the SDK's, or one minted here),
 * and its `request_id` / `trace_id` are printed per call.
 *
 * The token lives only in this process and is never returned to the browser.
 * Authorization is decided by the cloud; the proxy only forwards.
