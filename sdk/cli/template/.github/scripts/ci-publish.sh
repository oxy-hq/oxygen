# Does this repo publish its custom apps from CI, or does a human do it?
#
# OFF by default, and the default is the whole point. `customer-apps` — the
# monorepo Oxy ships its own custom apps from — deleted its publish CI outright
# and its engineers publish from their machines with `oxyc login` and
# `oxyc publish`; its own docs say "there is no GitHub Actions / CI". A repo
# scaffolded from this template therefore behaves the same way unless somebody
# asks for CI publishing, rather than arriving demanding a credential setup the
# rest of the org has already decided it does not want.
#
# In its own file for the same reason publish-env.sh is: a `run:` block cannot
# be executed anywhere but a runner, so anything left inline is unexecuted code
# until the first real push. This is the switch the whole opt-in rests on, so it
# is the last thing that should be unexecuted.
#
# THE SWITCH IS EXPLICIT, AND IT IS NOT THE CREDENTIAL. Skipping the publish
# whenever the job could not authenticate would have been one line, and it would
# have destroyed the property publish.yaml is built around: that a publish into
# a misconfigured environment is a loud credential failure rather than a quiet
# success. Inferred from the credential, "we do not publish from CI" and
# "somebody forgot production's trust policy" (or its OXY_TOKEN, on the fallback
# path) are the same observation — and the second one then ships nothing,
# silently, for as long as nobody looks. Two causes need two states, which is
# what this file is.
#
# A VARIABLE rather than a secret, for two reasons that both matter. It is read
# in the `build` job — the only job that runs when publishing is off, and so the
# only one that can say anything about it — and that job must reference no
# `secrets.` at all: it executes the bundles' own postinstall scripts, and the
# credential boundary in publish.yaml is enforced by a test that fails on any
# secret reference there. The second reason is plainer: a switch whose entire
# job is to tell "off on purpose" apart from "misconfigured" has to be legible,
# in Settings and in a run log. A secret is neither.
#
# Contract:
#   $1        the raw value, defaulting to $OXY_CI_PUBLISH — which publish.yaml
#             fills from `vars.OXY_CI_PUBLISH`. Passed explicitly only by the
#             tests.
#   stdout    `on` or `off`, one line. Nothing else, ever: the workflow captures
#             stdout into a job output that gates the publish job.
#   stderr    when off, the ::notice:: that names the self-serve command and
#             says how to turn CI publishing on.
#   exit 0    for a value this file recognises, an absent one included.
#   exit 1    for a value it does not.
#
# That last refusal is deliberate. `OXY_CI_PUBLISH=ture` cannot be read as
# either answer, and both guesses are wrong in a way nobody would see: read as
# off, the repo quietly stops publishing; read as on, it publishes when nobody
# asked. It fails in the `build` job, which holds no credential, before a single
# dependency is installed.
