/**
 * Validate the optional `functions` map. Each key is a function name; each value
 * declares how the function is invoked. Mirrors the server-side function-name
 * rule enforced at publish in `custom_apps_publish.rs` — `is_valid_function_name`,
 * checked in `record_functions` before any row is written.
 *
 * This runs at manifest LOAD (app boot / `pnpm dev`), not at `oxy build` — the
 * build-time gate is the vite plugin's `validateManifest`, which now checks
 * function names too. `oxyc publish` also validates them locally before esbuild,
 * so a bad name fails before the upload regardless.
