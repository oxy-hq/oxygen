# Agentic Browser Tests

Agent-driven browser tests written in YAML. The runner exposes only **generic browser tools** to an LLM (`browser_snapshot`, `browser_click`, `browser_type`, …) and lets the model read the page (accessibility tree) and act. There are no page-object wrappers in the registry, so UI churn (renamed test IDs, restructured menus) does not break the runner — the model just adapts at runtime.

The runtime lives in `runner/runtimes/bespoke.ts` (Anthropic SDK + Playwright with action-cache replay). The `Runtime` interface in `runtimes/interface.ts` keeps the seam open for swapping in a different runtime later (e.g. Stagehand v3) without touching the shared layers.

See [`internal-docs/agentic-browser-testing-spec.md`](../../../internal-docs/agentic-browser-testing-spec.md) for the deep dive: architecture, action-cache schema, selector materialization (v2 durability), CI integration, cost model + cache-invalidation taxonomy, change log, and the 2026-05-06 incident retrospective.

## Policy: read-only against external systems

**Flows and fixtures must never seed, drop, mutate, or otherwise destructively interact with any database, warehouse, port-forward, or shared service.** Only Oxy's own local state (its embedded Postgres in Docker, its workspace files on the local filesystem, the action-cache file) and committed-to-repo fixtures (DuckDB / Parquet / CSV under `demo_project/.db/`) may be written. Live warehouses, ClickHouse, Snowflake, BigQuery, Slack, GitHub — never.

This policy exists because of the [2026-05-06 incident](../../../internal-docs/agentic-browser-testing-spec.md#2026-05-06-incident) in which a `seed_clickhouse.sh` fixture, with defaults that exactly matched a `kubectl port-forward svc/clickhouse-pokehouse-chi 8123:8123` to the production cluster, ran during an unattended `--dangerously-skip-permissions` Claude Code session and dropped four tables (~3 years of menu line-item raw data, recovered slowly from Toast). The fixture and its consuming flow are gone; the structural fix is this policy plus the removal of fixture code that even *can* mutate an external system.

When authoring a new flow:

- Fixture data must be a file committed to this repo (DuckDB, Parquet, CSV) or generated deterministically into a temporary directory.
- The flow's `act:` prompts may type credentials only for local fixtures. If a step types a hostname, port, user, or password that could exist on a developer's `localhost`, do not use defaults that match a known production environment's port-forward.
- Do not add a `setup:` command that runs against an external HTTP endpoint, even one that "should be local."
- If a flow needs a warehouse, point it at DuckDB on a committed-to-repo file.

## Cold vs warm — what's actually being cached

There are **two independent caches** in the runtime. They serve very different purposes.

### 1. The action cache (the big lever)

A JSON file at `tests/agentic/.cache/bespoke-actions.json`. For every `act:` step that completes successfully, the runtime stores the recorded sequence of state-changing tool calls (`browser_click`, `browser_type`, `browser_press_key`, `browser_keyboard_type`, `browser_navigate`) — i.e. the actual deterministic actions the LLM ended up issuing.

- **Cold run** = action-cache miss for at least one step. The runtime opens an LLM loop (snapshot → tool-pick → dispatch → repeat) and re-derives the sequence. Typical cost per step: $0.05–0.20 input, depending on iterations.
- **Warm run** = action-cache hit. The runtime replays the recorded sequence directly against Playwright with **no LLM call**. Per-case cost floors at the judge call (~$0.002 with Haiku 4.5).
- **Invalidation** is drop-and-redrive: if a recorded selector no longer matches the page, the entry throws on replay, the runtime invalidates the entry, and re-derives from scratch. There is no partial-replay path.

The cache key is `sha256(flow_file | case_name | step_index | step_text)` by default — per-flow scope. Editing a step's text invalidates only that step's entry; adjacent steps in the same case still warm-replay. **Cross-flow reuse is opt-in via `cache_scope: shared`** on a per-step basis (key becomes `sha256("shared|" + step_text)`). Two flows with byte-identical step text that both opt into shared scope resolve to the same entry — record once, replay free across both. Canonical preludes live in [`canonical-prompts.md`](./canonical-prompts.md) — e.g. the chat prelude shared by `chat-ask` and `threads-list`.

`cache_actions: false` in flow settings disables the cache entirely (forces all steps cold).

### 2. Anthropic prompt cache (small lever, mostly invisible)

Anthropic's server-side prompt cache, reached via `cache_control: ephemeral` markers on the system prompt, the last tool definition, and the step prompt. 5-minute TTL, 4096-token minimum on Sonnet for an entry to actually materialise. Helps within a single multi-iteration step (iterations 2..N replay the prefix at 0.10× rate) and across consecutive same-session steps (the system+tools prefix stays warm).

You don't tune this — just be aware it's part of why cold cost numbers vary by 20–30% run-to-run.

### What this means for CI cost

Without cache persistence: every CI run on every PR pays cold cost for every step. ~$0.10–$0.40 per case on every push.

**With cache persistence** (already wired up, see the CI section below): the action cache is restored at the start of each CI run via `actions/cache` keyed on a hash of the flow files. Subsequent runs that don't touch flow text replay deterministically, dropping per-case cost to the judge floor (~$0.002).

For a **suite of 50 flows with overlapping UI traversal**, today there is no cross-flow reuse — every flow pays cold cost the first time even if it walks identical steps to another flow. The "shared cache key" mechanism in the followups doc would unlock that.

## Quick start

### 1. Install + configure

```bash
cd web-app
pnpm install
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-..." >> .env.local
```

### 2. Run

Every flow runs in **enterprise mode**, the production path, unless it opts out. The runner picks the backend boot by reading each flow's `settings.backend_mode` (default `cloud`, which means enterprise):

| `backend_mode` | what the runner does | runner targets |
|---|---|---|
| `cloud` (default) | `oxy start --enterprise` (repo root), then `oxy seed --workspace-path demo_project --llm-keys`, then a dev-login session as `flow@oxy.local` | `http://localhost:3000`, workspace paths prefixed with `/local/workspaces/70787bb2-e11b-5488-b2c3-02e60d5fc7d3` |
| `local` (legacy) | `oxy start --local --enterprise` (`demo_project/`) | `http://localhost:3000` (auth-disabled in `--local`) |

In enterprise mode (`runner/backend.ts`, `runner/session.ts`):

- **Fixture.** `demo_project/` is seeded as the `local` org's Demo workspace (the deterministic id above), compiled and promoted, with the LLM keys this shell exports stored as workspace secrets. `reset_test_file` / `restore_demo_file:` write `demo_project/` directly — it *is* the workspace's working copy.
- **Identity.** `flow@oxy.local`, bound as Owner of `local` by the seed (`OXY_GLOBAL_ADMINS` on the seed process only) and signed in through `GET /api/auth/dev-login`; the spawned server gets it on `OXY_DEV_LOGIN_EMAILS`. It has no platform standing, which is what every workspace flow needs. Override with `OXY_FLOW_EMAIL`, or export `OXY_SESSION_TOKEN` / `OXY_SESSION_USER` yourself (the admin flows do, as staff).
- **Routing.** `goto:` and `browser_navigate` paths get `OXY_PATH_PREFIX` (default the Demo workspace) unless they are a top-level surface (`/admin`, `/partners`, `/customer-apps`, `/dev-login`, …) or bare `/`, which the post-login dispatcher routes.
- **Git state.** `demo_project/` sits inside this repository, so the IDE sees *this checkout's* branch — and every IDE flow depends on which one it is. The flows are authored for a **named, non-default branch** (an ordinary feature branch): the IDE reads and writes the working copy directly. Two other states break them without saying so on screen:
  - **Detached HEAD** (a CI `pull_request` checkout, a fresh `git worktree add --detach`). The server names the branch `HEAD@<sha>`, the IDE sends that back as `?branch=`, and every branch-aware request answers 400. A run the runner signs in itself refuses to start on it (`[session] workspace … is on a detached HEAD`); CI runs `git switch -C agentic-ci` before booting. A run handed its own `OXY_SESSION_TOKEN` (the `verify-all.sh` phases) is not checked, so there the same state still fails the slow way.
  - **The default branch** (`main`). It is protected, so a save forks a feature branch into a worktree of the whole repository, and reads on the default branch serve the revision the seed compiled — not what a flow just wrote — with no Compile button on a single process to ship it.

`local` is the unmaintained `--local` mode: no auth, one fixed workspace, nothing it shows says anything about the product. No committed flow uses it; opt in only for a flow that tests legacy local mode itself.

If a backend is already healthy at the resolved URL, the runner uses it as-is: no respawn **and no seed**. A stack from `just up` has `examples/` as its Demo workspace and does not list `flow@oxy.local` for dev-login, so either stop it and let the runner spawn its own, or seed and sign in yourself:

```bash
OXY_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:15432/oxy OXY_GLOBAL_ADMINS=flow@oxy.local \
  ./target/debug/oxy seed --workspace-path demo_project --llm-keys   # re-points Demo at demo_project/
OXY_FLOW_EMAIL=<a staff email from OXY_GLOBAL_ADMINS> pnpm test:agentic chat-ask
```

All flows loaded in a single invocation must agree on `backend_mode` — the runner errors loudly if you mix.

Requires `oxy` on `PATH` (or `target/debug/oxy`) and Docker running, since `oxy start` brings up Postgres in a container.

```bash
pnpm test:agentic                          # every flow (admin + fleet flows need their own identity/backend — see below)
pnpm test:agentic chat-ask                 # filename match
pnpm test:agentic --tag critical           # tag filter
pnpm test:agentic --output results.json    # write JSON (also auto-written under .results/)
HEADED=1 pnpm test:agentic chat-ask        # see browser
DEBUG=1 pnpm test:agentic chat-ask         # stream agent reasoning
pnpm test:agentic --no-auto-backend        # skip backend auto-start
pnpm test:agentic --no-auto-frontend       # skip Vite auto-start
```

Set `OXY_BIN=$PWD/target/debug/oxy` if your system `oxy` on PATH is older than your local debug build (a common cause of `--enterprise: unrecognized argument`).

Override the resolved URL with `OXY_BASE_URL` / `OXY_HEALTH_URL` if you want the runner to drive a backend you already have running on a non-default port.

## Authoring a flow

Files live in `flows/<name>.flow.test.yml`. Schema: [`json-schemas/flow-test.json`](../../../json-schemas/flow-test.json).

```yaml
name: chat ask returns SQL artifact
target: chat               # documentation hint only

settings:
  runs: 1
  trace: on-failure
  cache_actions: true
  max_steps: 15

setup:
  - "goto:/"

cases:
  - name: ask a question and get a SQL artifact
    tags: [chat, critical]
    steps:
      - act: |
          Submit a question to the analytics agent on the home page chat panel.
          The demo ships a single agent (`analytics`), selected by default:
          1. Type 'What were the total weekly sales by store?' into textarea[name=question].
          2. Click [data-testid=chat-panel-submit-button].
      - wait_for: streaming_complete
    expect:
      - judge: "the analytics agent answered with a coherent, data-backed result about weekly sales per store, not an error"
```

### Writing effective `act:` prompts

The model needs **enough specificity to pick selectors correctly first try.** Vague prompts cost 5–10× more because each wrong selector burns 5s before the model adjusts. Concrete patterns that work:

- **Explicit data-testid when stable**: `Click [data-testid=agent-selector-button]`. The model uses it verbatim.
- **Numbered sub-steps in one prompt** when the actions are tightly coupled — see the chat-ask example above. The whole sequence stays atomic from the cache's perspective but the model plans ahead.
- **Disambiguators when the page has duplicates**: `Click the file editor's Monaco surface (selector .monaco-editor) — the top one, NOT the SQL results pane below`.
- **State changes worth waiting for**: `After clicking, the URL should change to /ide/files/<base64>` — orients the model on what success looks like.
- **Tool hints when the right primitive is non-obvious**: for Monaco, `Use browser_keyboard_type (NOT browser_type — Monaco's hidden textarea makes selector-based fill unreliable)`. The model respects these hints.

What to avoid:

- ❌ Pure natural language without selectors when the page has multiple matching elements (the agent selector page has the word "default" in 3 places — without a testid, the model picks the wrong one).
- ❌ "Verify X" steps that don't actually act on the page — use `expect: assert:` or `expect: judge:` instead.
- ❌ `force: true` on `browser_snapshot` (the model can pass it but rarely should — the in-turn snapshot cache is automatically refreshed by state-changing tools).

### Atomic vs compound steps

The runtime always lets the LLM chain multiple tool calls within one step's turn — there's no `compound: true` flag. The choice between **atomic** (one short prompt per logical action) and **compound** (one long prompt that drives a full sub-sequence) is purely a YAML authoring decision.

- **Atomic** wins when individual actions are independently meaningful or when one part of the flow churns more than the rest (each step is its own cache entry, so the changed part re-derives but the rest still warm-replays).
- **Compound** wins when the sub-sequence is short and tightly coupled — fewer step boundaries means smaller cumulative LLM context per iteration.

Measured 2026-05-04 for the existing flows: **atomic wins** for `ide-save` (cold $0.34 atomic vs $0.42 compound; warm tied at ~$0.002). `chat-ask` is already minimal (one act + one wait_for) — no choice to make.

When authoring a new flow, write one variant first; if cold cost exceeds ~$0.30/case, try the other variant and commit the winner.

### Step types

- `act: <text>` — natural language. The LLM reads the page via `browser_snapshot` and chooses generic browser actions.
- `wait_for: <primitive>` — built-in waits:
  - `streaming_complete` — the chat stream finishes (loading state appears, then the stop button hides).
  - `network_idle` — Playwright's `networkidle` (no network activity for 500ms).
  - `selector:<sel>` — element matching `<sel>` becomes visible. Optional `;timeout_ms=<n>` suffix overrides the default 30s wait (use for legitimately-long waits like the agentic build phase).
  - `selector_hidden:<sel>` — element matching `<sel>` disappears. Counterpart to `selector:`; same `;timeout_ms=<n>` suffix. Use this when the act step finishes faster than the UI it triggers (e.g. warm-replay screenshots before a `[data-testid=app-preview-loading]` spinner clears).

## Generic browser tools

Defined in `runner/tool-registry.ts`. Available to the LLM in every step:

| Tool | Use |
|---|---|
| `browser_snapshot` | Compact a11y-tree text. Always call this first. ≤12kB. Optional `region: "main"` or `region: "<css selector>"` to scope. |
| `browser_click` | Click by Playwright selector (text=, role=, [data-testid=…]). 5s timeout — wrong selectors fail fast. |
| `browser_type` | Fill or append into an input/textarea. 5s timeout. |
| `browser_press_key` | Single key or chord (Enter, Meta+s, …). |
| `browser_keyboard_type` | Type via raw keyboard into the focused element. Use for Monaco. |
| `browser_file_upload` | Attach files to an `<input type="file">` via Playwright's `setInputFiles`. Built for the workspace setup wizard's DuckDB upload step (no committed flow uses it since `onboarding-blank-workspace` was deleted). Paths are repo-relative; absolute paths and `..` traversal are refused. |
| `browser_navigate` | Go to a URL. |
| `browser_screenshot` | PNG base64. Expensive; the judge already screenshots, so prefer `browser_snapshot`. |
| `browser_wait_for_selector` | Wait up to 10s for visibility. |
| `browser_get_page_text` | Truncated `body.innerText` fallback when snapshot is too noisy. |

Only the six state-changing tools (`click`, `type`, `press_key`, `keyboard_type`, `navigate`, `file_upload`) are recorded into the action cache. Snapshots and screenshots are observation-only.

## Expectation types

- `assert: <claim>` — deterministic, evaluated by `runner/judge.ts`. Supported forms:
  - `selector <sel> is visible` / `is not visible`
  - `selector <sel> has attribute <attr>=<value>`
  - `selector <sel> has a non-empty value` — reads `inputValue()`. Use this for
    pre-filled inputs: a controlled React input sets the value *property*, so
    `has attribute value=` cannot see it.
  - `selector <sel> does not contain text "<text>"` — reads `textContent()`.
    Use this for non-inputs, e.g. asserting a shadcn `SelectTrigger` (a button)
    is no longer showing its placeholder.
  - `text "<text>" is visible`
  - `<description> is enabled` (for follow-up input, etc.)
  - `save button is not visible` (waits up to 5s for the IDE save button to hide)
- `judge: <claim>` — LLM-as-judge against current screenshot + DOM text. Cheap with `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`.

Asserts cost $0; judge calls cost ~$0.002 each. Use asserts wherever the claim is structural; reserve judge for soft semantic claims ("the response is coherent and not an error").

## Setup commands

- `reset_test_file` — empties `demo_project/test.sql` so the IDE save flow starts clean on rerun. Refuses (loud throw) if the resolved path is a symlink or escapes the repo root.
- `restore_demo_file:<rel>` — reverts `demo_project/<rel>` to its committed-in-HEAD content via `git show HEAD:demo_project/<rel>`. Used by flows that mutate a demo file (e.g. the builder agent editing `insights.app.yml`) so reruns start from the same canonical state. Refuses paths that escape the repo, contain `..`, or resolve through a symlink. Reads from HEAD without touching the index, so a developer's staged changes elsewhere are unaffected.
- `goto:/path` — navigate to a URL relative to `OXY_BASE_URL` (default `http://localhost:3000`), with `OXY_PATH_PREFIX` (the Demo workspace, in enterprise mode) applied to workspace-scoped paths.

The set is intentionally small. New setup commands are subject to the read-only-against-external-systems policy at the top of this file — propose any addition that needs network access on the followups doc first.

### Seeding the data a flow reads — `scripts/seed-fixtures.sh`

Because the list above cannot reach a database, **no flow seeds its own fixtures**. Anything a flow needs to exist — a workspace, a compiled + promoted revision, a published custom app, a partner org — is stood up from the shell before the runner starts:

```bash
scripts/seed-fixtures.sh fleet     # the docker fleet: seeds via the ide container, verifies at a replica
scripts/seed-fixtures.sh native    # a running `oxy serve`/`oxy start`: seeds via ./target/debug/oxy
scripts/seed-fixtures.sh check     # verify only, no writes
scripts/seed-observability.sh      # ClickHouse spans + metric usage for the four observability flows
```

`just verify` runs the right one for each phase, so you usually do not call these by hand.

Two things worth knowing before you debug a red flow:

- **It verifies over HTTP, not SQL.** Every check is a real request against the same routes the browser uses, because a row that exists but 403s, 404s, or hangs off an unpromoted revision is indistinguishable from no row at all from where Playwright sits. Exit 1 means "seeded, but a fixture is missing from the node the flows drive" — start there before blaming the product.
- **Identity is half the fixture.** The runner injects exactly one session per invocation. `flow@oxy.local` is an org owner with no platform standing and is what every workspace-scoped flow needs; the SPA bounces staff off a tenant workspace into `/admin`, so a workspace flow signed in as staff times out on a testid that was never going to render. The admin and partner surfaces need the opposite. `scripts/verify-all.sh --group b --dry-run` prints which identity each invocation uses, for free.

### Environment-variable substitution in `act:` text

`act:` step text supports `${VAR_NAME}` placeholders. The runner validates them at YAML load time (a missing variable throws), and substitutes the real values **only at the egress boundaries** — when the prompt is sent to the Anthropic API and when a state-changing tool dispatches into Playwright. Everywhere else (step text in result JSON, recorded actions in `.cache/bespoke-actions.json`, debug `tool_calls` args) the placeholder is what's stored.

```yaml
- act: "Type ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY} into the API key input."
```

Concretely, on a flow that types `${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}`:

- The Anthropic API receives the literal key (necessary so the LLM knows what to type).
- Playwright receives the literal key (so the input fills correctly).
- The action cache stores `browser_type({selector: "#secure-input", text: "${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}"})`.
- The result artifact (`agentic-results-<flow>.json`) stores the same placeholder.

The allowlist of redacted env vars lives in `runner/secrets.ts` (`SECRET_ENV_VARS`). Add new entries when a flow needs them. The redactor errors loudly if an allowlisted plaintext value would still reach disk — defense in depth.

Older flows under `cache_actions: false` were written before egress substitution shipped. The flag now protects only against operational concerns (e.g. wanting to force every step cold for a benchmark); it is no longer required for secret-handling correctness.

### Enterprise mode, identities, and the admin flows

Enterprise mode drives the **authenticated** public port (3000) with a real session, not the auth-disabled internal port (3001): the internal port carries neither `enforce_role` nor the ide proxy, and its `/api/user` answers `null` to a cookie-less browser, so the SPA's admin gate bounced every admin flow that tried it. The session comes from dev-login, the same endpoint `/dev-login?as=<persona>` uses (see the `oxy-run-and-verify` skill).

The runner injects **one** session per invocation. `flow@oxy.local` (the default) is what every workspace flow needs; the admin flows (`admin-*`, `airway-pipeline-run`) need a staff identity, so `scripts/verify-all.sh` phase 4 starts `oxy start --enterprise` itself, runs `oxy seed ./examples` (the partner tenants and `health_check:` block they read), mints a staff session and hands it to the runner in `OXY_SESSION_TOKEN`. No UI creates an org any more — orgs are provisioned by staff or a partner — so every enterprise flow depends on a seed having run first; the runner's own spawn seeds `demo_project/`, and anything else is seeded from the shell (`scripts/seed-fixtures.sh`). Keep the warehouse file-based (DuckDB), so a flow stays structurally incapable of hitting a port-forward to production — the failure mode of the 2026-05-06 incident. `builder-edits-app` edits `demo_project/insights.app.yml` in the Demo workspace, with a `restore_demo_file:insights.app.yml` setup command to revert the builder's edits between runs.

### Driving a fleet or remote deployment (bypassing `backend_mode`)

`backend_mode` only controls what the runner **auto-spawns** and whether it signs
in — `cloud` (default) runs `oxy start --enterprise` + the demo_project seed and
mints a `flow@oxy.local` session unless one is exported; `local` runs `oxy start
--local --enterprise` (`runner/backend.ts`, `spawnArgs`; `runner/session.ts`). It is not a fixture selector and does not
declare which deployment topology a flow supports. Pass `--no-auto-backend` to skip
spawning entirely (`runner/cli.ts:170-172`) and set `OXY_BASE_URL` / `OXY_HEALTH_URL`
/ `OXY_SESSION_TOKEN` / `OXY_SESSION_USER` yourself to point the runner at an
already-running backend — including one replica of the Docker split fleet
([`docker-compose.fleet.yml`](../../../docker-compose.fleet.yml), see
[`internal-docs/local-split-fleet-testing.md`](../../../internal-docs/local-split-fleet-testing.md)).
`scripts/fleet-assert.sh --flows` does exactly this. The mixed-`backend_mode` refusal
still applies to whatever flows are loaded in one invocation, though —
`pickBackendMode` runs unconditionally, before `--no-auto-backend` is even checked
(`runner/cli.ts:159`, `:289-297`) — so `--no-auto-backend` only skips the spawn, not
the one-mode-per-invocation rule. Every committed flow is on the default (enterprise)
mode, so any subset can share an invocation; a caller-exported session and
`OXY_PATH_PREFIX` always win over the runner's defaults.

Two structural limits worth knowing before trying to widen fleet coverage:

- **One session per invocation.** `runtimes/bespoke.ts` reads `OXY_SESSION_TOKEN` /
  `OXY_SESSION_USER` once and injects them into a single Playwright browser context
  used for every case in the run (`runner/runtimes/bespoke.ts:122-156`). Admin flows
  need a staff identity; workspace-scoped flows need a non-staff one — staff reach is
  not standing, so a Global Owner gets bounced off every tenant workspace into
  `/admin` (see `product-context.md`, "Roles"). No single invocation can cover both
  today; that needs a per-flow `identity:` field in the schema, which doesn't exist
  yet.
- **`applyPathPrefix` and non-workspace-scoped routes.** `goto:` targets are prefixed
  with `OXY_PATH_PREFIX` (the runner defaults it to the Demo workspace in enterprise
  mode) so flow text names a surface, not a workspace (`runner/backend.ts`,
  `applyPathPrefix`). Routes that hang
  off the app root instead of a workspace — `TOP_LEVEL_SURFACES`: `/admin`,
  `/partners`, `/customer-apps`, `/login`, `/dev-login`, `/invite`, `/cli-auth`
  (`runner/backend.ts:101-109`) — must be listed there, or the prefix produces a URL
  that routes nowhere. Three admin flows failed exactly that way before the list
  existed, each looking like an unrelated broken page rather than one misconfigured
  harness.

## Output format

Every run produces two artifacts under `tests/agentic/.results/<iso-timestamp>.{json,md}`:

- A machine-readable JSON file with full per-step debug data, token usage, and USD cost.
- A markdown summary with one row per case run plus a per-step debug table per run. Designed to be readable in a GitHub Actions step summary (auto-appended to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` in CI) or in a terminal.

If you pass `--output <path>.json`, the JSON is also written there.

JSON shape (see `runner/types.ts:RunResults`):

`cost_usd` at the run level is the sum of all per-step costs **plus** that run's judge cost. The top-level `cost_usd` is the grand total across all runs in the invocation. `pricing_as_of` records when the rate table was last verified — see `runner/pricing.ts` to update rates.

### Step debug fields

Each entry in `step_debug` describes one step in `case.steps` (in order):

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `step_index` | 0-based index of the step in the case |
| `kind` | `act` (LLM-driven) or `wait_for` (no LLM) |
| `text` | The raw `act:` prompt or `wait_for:` primitive |
| `duration_ms` | Wall-clock time the step took |
| `iterations` | Number of LLM tool-pick iterations (`0` for cache hits and wait_for) |
| `model` | Model that handled this step. Undefined for cache hits. |
| `tokens` / `cost_usd` | Per-step usage and USD cost under `model` |
| `from_cache` | True if this step replayed from the action cache (no LLM call) |
| `tool_calls` | Ordered list of tools invoked during this step, with args (truncated where long) and ms |
| `snapshot_calls` / `snapshot_cache_hits` / `snapshot_bytes` | Snapshot stats for the step |
| `escalated` / `initial_model` | Reserved for future haiku→sonnet escalation; undefined today |
| `error` | Step error message if the step threw |

A failing run's `step_debug` is the first thing to read when triaging — `iterations`, `tool_calls` (with args), and `error` together usually pinpoint the failure.

## Debugging a flow

1. Run with `HEADED=1 DEBUG=1` to watch the browser and see per-iteration LLM decisions.
2. Read the latest `tests/agentic/.results/<ts>.md` for a per-step cost + tool-call summary.
3. For deeper diagnosis, open the `.json` from the same timestamp and inspect `step_debug[].tool_calls` — every tool call shows args (the selector the model tried) and any error.
4. If the case failed mid-stream, open the Playwright trace at the path printed in `step_debug[].trace_path`: `pnpm exec playwright show-trace tests/agentic/.traces/<flow>-<case>.zip`.
5. If a single step is consuming many iterations (>5), read the prompt — usually it's missing a disambiguating selector or a required pre-condition (e.g. clicking a button that's only enabled after a previous action).

Common failure modes and fixes:

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Step burns 30s on a `browser_click` | Wrong selector — model is waiting on Playwright's old default. The runtime now uses 5s; if you still see 30s, you're on an outdated branch. |
| Step takes 12+ iterations | Vague `act:` prompt — add explicit selectors or numbered sub-steps. |
| `assert: "selector ... is visible"` flakes | The page renders the element late. Insert a `wait_for: selector:<sel>` step before the assertion, or use `judge:` (which captures a screenshot at evaluation time). |
| Save button assertion races (IDE flow) | `save button is not visible` already does a 5s waitFor — extend if your flow takes longer to flush. |
| Monaco appears empty after typing | Use `browser_keyboard_type`, not `browser_type`. Click `.monaco-editor` first to focus. The 25ms keystroke delay is built in. |
| `model: claude-sonnet-4-7` returns 404 | Not yet GA on the account. Use `claude-sonnet-4-6` until 4-7 ships (see `runner/yaml-loader.ts:DEFAULT_SETTINGS.model`). |

## Cost expectations

| Scenario | Per-case cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cold (cache miss) | $0.05–0.40 | Variance is mostly LLM iteration count. A well-written `act:` prompt with explicit selectors tends to converge in 1–4 iterations and lands ~$0.05; a vague prompt that has the model second-guessing burns 10+ iterations and lands at the high end. |
| Warm (cache hit, full flow) | $0.002–0.005 | Just judge calls. Replay is microseconds. |
| Cold first-ever run, full suite of 50 cases | $5–$20 estimated | One-time. Fund this against the plan to ship CI persistence. |
| Subsequent CI runs, same flows | $0.10–0.25 | Just judge calls × N cases. |
| CI run with 1 flow's text edited | $0.10 + (cold cost for the edited flow) | Other 49 cache-hit. |

The cost reporter writes `cost_usd` per step, per run, and per total. Trust those numbers for budgeting — they apply Anthropic's published rates (input × 1× / cache-read × 0.10× / cache-write × 1.25× / output × 1×) per the table in `runner/pricing.ts`.

### The per-case limit, and why a failing case is the expensive one

Every case run is metered (`runner/budget.ts`) and stopped at **$2.00**: the step that would cross it fails with `stopped at the $2.00 budget`, the case fails, and the next case starts with a fresh meter. `AGENTIC_CASE_BUDGET_USD=<dollars>` moves the limit; `0` or `off` removes it.

The limit exists because a case that *cannot* pass costs far more than one that does. An `act:` step that never reaches its goal is not a failed step — the model keeps trying until `max_steps`, then the next `act:` starts on the same broken page and does it again. Each turn re-sends the whole conversation so far (only the system prompt, the tool list and the step text are prompt-cached; every snapshot and tool result after them is billed as fresh input on every later turn), so a step's cost grows with the square of its turns: 30 turns averaging ~40k tokens is 1.2M input tokens, about $3.60. `browser_screenshot` makes it worse — its PNG comes back as base64 *text*, cut at 16k characters, which the model cannot read and pays for again on every turn after. On 2026-10-01 one bucket spent $11.50 this way across three cases whose graph had failed to load.

The limit bounds that; a gate prevents it. Follow an `act:` whose result the next step depends on with a `wait_for: selector:…` — a missing element then fails the case in 30 seconds for $0, instead of handing the next step a page it will spend its whole turn budget exploring.

## CI

CI integration lives in `.github/workflows/agentic-tests.yaml`, a reusable workflow that `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` calls via `workflow_call`. The same file can also be triggered standalone via `workflow_dispatch` (with a `flow_bucket` input to run a single bucket, and an `oxy_binary_run_id` input pointing at a prior CI run's binary artifact). It runs on PRs and pushes to main when the `oxy` or `agentic` change group fired (`.github/workflows/changesets.yaml`), and on manual `workflow_dispatch`.

**What actually gates it is the binary.** The matrix needs the `oxy-binary-ci` artifact from `cargo-check-and-test`, and a skipped need skips its dependents — so the `web-app == 'true'` in the job's own `if:` runs nothing by itself. `oxy` (any Rust change) builds the binary as part of the full check; `agentic` (the flows, the runner, `agentic-tests.yaml` and its composite actions, `demo_project/`) builds it in the build-only shape, with no clippy or nextest. A PR that changes only `web-app/src/**` still runs no browser test: nothing builds a binary carrying its bundle. Before the `agentic` group existed, a PR confined to this directory and the workflow ran none either, which is how every bucket moved to enterprise mode with three of the six red.

A `resolve-matrix` setup job emits the 6-bucket matrix as JSON; the main `agentic-tests` job consumes it via `strategy.matrix.flow`. Each sub-job:

- Downloads the prebuilt CI binary via the `download-oxy-binary` composite action (`.github/actions/download-oxy-binary/`), which supports both same-run and cross-run downloads.
- Sets up pnpm + Node + Playwright (cached) via the `setup-web-app-test-env` composite action (`.github/actions/setup-web-app-test-env/`).
- Puts the checkout on a named branch (`git switch -C agentic-ci`). A `pull_request` checkout is a detached HEAD, and the Demo workspace lives inside it — see "Git state" under Run.
- Boots an ephemeral Postgres service container.
- Boots Oxy in the bucket's `backend_mode` and health-checks the appropriate port.
- **Restores the action cache via `actions/cache`** keyed on a hash of every flow YAML + the bespoke runtime files. On a cache hit, every step that's text-identical to a previously-recorded step replays without an LLM call. Falls back to a prefix-match restore-key on flow edits, so unchanged steps still warm-replay.
- Runs `pnpm test:agentic <flow1> <flow2> ... --no-auto-backend --no-auto-frontend --output ../agentic-results-<bucket>.json`.
- Uploads `agentic-results-<bucket>.json`, `web-app/tests/agentic/.results/`, `.traces/`, and `.logs/` (`backend.log`, `seed.log`) as the `agentic-results-<bucket>` artifact. The three dot-directories need `include-hidden-files: true`; without it the artifact is the JSON alone.
- On `pull_request` events, reads `web-app/tests/agentic/.results/healing.json` and (if non-empty) posts a markdown drift-events table via `.github/scripts/agentic-healing-comment.mjs`.

The job is `continue-on-error: true` while we calibrate. Flip it to `false` once the suite is steady-state.

### What invalidates the CI cache

- Editing any `.flow.test.yml` file → exact-key miss, prefix restore from the prior cache. Unchanged step text still hits.
- Editing `runner/runtimes/bespoke.ts`, `runner/tool-registry.ts`, or `runner/action-cache.ts` → exact-key miss with prefix restore. The cache schema version (`CACHE_VERSION` in `action-cache.ts`) auto-invalidates entries with mismatched version, so a runtime change that breaks replay is already self-healing — the cache key bump just makes invalidation instant rather than per-step lazy.

If you intentionally want to nuke the cache (e.g. to remeasure cold cost), bump `CACHE_VERSION` in `runner/action-cache.ts` or just add a comment to the cache-key inputs to flip the hash.

## Troubleshooting

- **`backend did not become healthy`** — `oxy start --enterprise` (or the legacy `oxy start --local --enterprise`) failed. Tail `web-app/tests/agentic/.logs/backend.log`. Most often Docker isn't running, or the system `oxy` binary on PATH is older than the workspace build (set `$OXY_BIN` to the freshly built one).
- **`oxy seed failed`** — tail `web-app/tests/agentic/.logs/seed.log`. A compile error in `demo_project/` fails the seed (every seeded workspace points at it).
- **`[session] dev-login as flow@oxy.local failed: 404 / 403`** — the backend you are reusing does not list the identity in `OXY_DEV_LOGIN_EMAILS`. Stop it and let the runner spawn its own, or see "Run" above for signing in as someone it does list.
- **Every page lands on `/onboarding`** — dev-login minted an account that belongs to no org: the backend was never seeded with `OXY_GLOBAL_ADMINS=flow@oxy.local`.
- **`[session] workspace … is on a detached HEAD`** — the checkout holding `demo_project/` has no branch, so every IDE request would answer 400. `git switch -c <name>` and rerun. See "Git state" under Run.
- **`stopped at the $2.00 budget`** — the case hit its spend limit, almost always because an earlier step left the page somewhere the later ones cannot work from. Read `step_debug` for the first step whose `tool_calls` end in errors, and gate it with a `wait_for:`. Raise `AGENTIC_CASE_BUDGET_USD` only for a case that is legitimately that expensive.
- **`cannot run flows with mixed backend_mode`** — you loaded a glob that matched a flow opted into the legacy `local` mode alongside enterprise ones. Filter to one mode per invocation.
- **Stale local cache** — delete `tests/agentic/.cache/bespoke-actions.json` to force a full re-derive on the next run, or pass `cache_actions: false` in the flow's settings.
- **Snapshot too large** — the LLM can call `browser_get_page_text` as a fallback, or `browser_snapshot` with `region: "main"` to scope. If it consistently struggles, narrow the `act:` prompt or split the step.
- **Judge cost too high** — flip `expect: judge:` to `expect: assert:` where possible; judge is for soft claims only. Cheaper still: use a deterministic `selector ... has attribute ...` assert.
