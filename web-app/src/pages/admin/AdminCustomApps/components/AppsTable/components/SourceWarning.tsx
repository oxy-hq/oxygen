/**
 * Marks an app whose currently-serving build doesn't record both a git repo
 * and a commit — either half alone can't reach the code.
 *
 * Renders nothing when the app is traceable, so a clean list stays clean and
 * the mark reads as an exception rather than decoration. That's the whole
 * job: scanning the list should be how you find the apps nobody can maintain,
 * without opening each one.
 *
 * The list only carries a boolean, so the copy here stays accurate for all
 * three shapes rather than naming a half that might be present. The build
 * history in the detail pane has the fields and says exactly which is
 * missing.
 *
 * `oxyc publish` warns about this at publish time too. This is the surface for
 * the ones that already shipped — including every app published before that
 * warning existed.
