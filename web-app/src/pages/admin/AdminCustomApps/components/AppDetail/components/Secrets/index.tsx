/**
 * The AppDetail "Secrets" section: every key this app needs, and whether it has

 *
 * The list is the union of two things, which is the whole point of the section.
 * What the app's active build **declares** — the `env` block in `oxy-app.json`,
 * plus every function's `webhook.secretVar` — and what is actually **stored**
 * under `apps/<app_id>/`. Before this, the only way to see an app secret was the
 * workspace settings table, where it appeared as a raw `apps/<uuid>/KEY` row
 * among every other project secret, and the only way to *create* one was from
 * inside a function that could not run without it.
 *
 * Rows a person has to act on come first and are the only coloured thing here.
 * A healthy key carries no badge at all: badging every row is what stops the
 * broken one from standing out.
