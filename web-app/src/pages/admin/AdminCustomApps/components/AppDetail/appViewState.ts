/**
 * What an admin app view *is*, expressed as query params.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 * A **location** goes in the URL; a personal **layout preference** stays in
 * `localStorage`. "Bookkeeping, draft channel, on mobile, builds section open,
 * showing the vendor screen" is a place an operator wants to send someone. Dock
 * right-vs-bottom and whether their dossier is pinned is how *they* like to sit,
 * and a shared link that rearranged the recipient's panels would be a bug.
 *
 * That split is why `dock`, `dossierPinned` and the per-section collapse state
 * are untouched by this module and stay in `usePersistentState`.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately absent
 *
 * The debug panel's selected request. Its id is a per-session counter over
 * whatever calls that frame happened to make, so `?req=3` names a different
 * request on every load — a link that reproduces the wrong row is worse than
 * one that reproduces nothing. The panel's open/closed state is layout, so it
 * follows the rule above.
