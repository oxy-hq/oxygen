/**
 * Landing at `/:orgSlug`. OrgGuard has already verified the slug resolves to a
 * member org, so we just pick a workspace and redirect. An org with no
 * navigable workspace — none yet, or every one still cloning — renders the
 * "being set up" screen in place (clearing a stale lastWorkspace id) rather
 * than sending anyone into onboarding: orgs are provisioned for their members.
 * Failed workspaces are navigable (the workspace shell surfaces the error +
 * retry), so they count as pick targets.
 *
 * Resolves the org from the URL slug (not from `useCurrentOrg`) on purpose:
 * OrgGuard updates the Zustand store inside a useEffect, which fires *after*
 * this child renders. Reading from the store on the first render after an org
 * switch would return the *previous* org. With the previous org's workspaces
 * already hot in the React Query cache, `useAllWorkspaces` would return them
 * synchronously, `pickWorkspace` would pick the previous org's last workspace,
 * and the `<Navigate>` would bounce the user right back where they came from —
 * making the org switcher (or a direct URL change to /:newOrgSlug) appear to
 * silently do nothing.
