/**
 * The old chat-home's gating logic, extracted: workspace match and setup gaps
 * (per-agent LLM key resolution, warehouse creds, no-db/no-agent). Originally
 * copied verbatim from pages/home — see git history of pages/home/index.tsx
 * for the original inline comments and rationale.
 *
 * Home never redirects into the setup wizard. It used to — first on any
 * missing credential, later only on pending wizard state — and every version
 * dragged someone who just wanted their apps into a setup flow they didn't
 * own. Workspaces are set up by the Oxygen team now, so the credential gaps
 * are "Finish setup" rows shown only to staff (see `canFinishSetup`); the
 * comment at `needsSetupProbe` explains why Home doesn't even make that call
 * on the common path.
