# Assert the split-fleet contract over HTTP, with no browser involved.
#
# The browser flows in web-app/tests/agentic/ assert what a PAGE shows. This
# asserts what the FLEET does underneath: which node answers a route, whether
# two replicas agree, and what survives when the ide node dies. None of that is
# visible to a flow — a flow drives one base URL and cannot see the
# `x-oxy-served-by` header, let alone compare replicas.
#
# The failure this exists to catch is the one the compile boundary was built
# for: a read that needs the workspace FILES answering on a node that has none.
# Its signature is not an exception — it is a 200 with an empty body, or a route
# quietly answered by the wrong node. A route counts as covered here only when
# a REAL request (real session, valid parameters, a response worth comparing)
# reaches the handler — an unauthenticated probe that only reads
# `x-oxy-served-by` proves the router classified the route, never that the
# HANDLER behaves correctly on a node with no working copy. See
# internal-docs/2026-08-25-fleet-http-route-coverage.md for the inventory this
# harness's route table was built from, and its Methodology section for why
# `route_declarations()` is the source of truth rather than grep.
#
# WHAT THIS CANNOT PROVE. Both nodes here run on one machine, so the workspace
# directory physically exists for the `serve` process too. `OXY_ROLE=serve`
# makes it DECLARE that it owns no working copy, and every assertion below tests
# that the declaration is honoured. It cannot catch code that skips the
# capability check and reads the disk anyway — that read succeeds here and fails
# in production. Only docker-compose.fleet.yml, where the serve containers have
# no volume, makes the directory genuinely absent. Run this for the contract;
# run the fleet compose for the absence.
#
#   scripts/fleet-assert.sh                # assert against whatever is built
#   scripts/fleet-assert.sh --build        # build first, then assert  ← after a code change
#   scripts/fleet-assert.sh docker --build # same, against the compose fleet
#   scripts/fleet-assert.sh --keep         # leave the fleet running afterwards
#   scripts/fleet-assert.sh --skip-fixtures # only the "Now" bucket — no disposable creates
#   scripts/fleet-assert.sh docker --build --flows   # …and then drive the browser
#                                                    # flows at the same replica
#
# `--flows` is opt-in because it costs real money: the flows pick their actions
# with an LLM. Everything else here is free, so it must stay runnable on every
# save without a bill.
#
# `--build` is opt-in rather than the default so the two failure kinds stay
# distinguishable: a build error exits 2 ("could not test this"), a violated
# assertion exits 1 ("tested it, the product is wrong"). Collapsing them would
# make a red run ambiguous. Both builders are incremental, so `--build` is cheap
# to pass after a one-line edit and correct to pass after a merge.
#
# The assertions are identical in both modes — only where the URLs come from and
# how the ide is stopped differ. `docker` mode is the one that proves ABSENCE:
# there the serve containers have no state volume, so the workspace directory
# genuinely is not on them.
#
# ── The route table (scripts/fleet-routes.tsv) ──────────────────────────────
# Its rows are declaration tuples out of
# `oxy_app::server::router::route_declarations()` — see that file's header for
# the recipe (a temporary #[test], run once, deleted) and for how far the table
# currently is from that function's output. This script does not hand-maintain
# a route list; it reads that file, buckets every row (Now / Fixture / Destr /
# Ext / Struct), and REPORTS coverage honestly: what ran, what a disposable
# fixture created, and what was left out with a stated reason.
#
# It reports coverage of the ROWS, not of the product: a route that lands in
# route_declarations() without a row is invisible here. (This comment used to
# promise a "declared but not in the catalog" listing; no phase ever printed
# one.) What does hold the rows to the code is
# `crates/app/tests/routing/fleet_routes_table.rs`.

#                         does not exist on any deployment.
#   launcher-home       — two of its three cases need a workspace with NO apps;
#                         `oxy seed` always publishes oxy-starter, so that state
#                         is unreachable here rather than broken.

# A route whose query targets a `dataset:` path INSIDE the workspace working
# copy (e.g. DuckDB "local", `dataset: .db/`, no `s3_mirror` configured on
# this fixture) can never succeed on a stateless replica — that node does not
# have the directory and never will. Demanding serve==ide there asserts the
# impossible; three cases did exactly that and were wrongly logged as product
# defects before this was caught. The contract that IS true, and the one this
# helper checks per replica: it must refuse LOUDLY (5xx) — never answer 2xx,
# and *especially* never a 2xx with an empty/wrong result, which is the
# failure-as-absence shape this whole harness exists to catch.
#
# `does not have` is not an arbitrary substring: it is the exact, tested
# phrase `ResolveWorkspaceFile`'s no-disk arm returns
# (crates/core/src/config/manager.rs:157-158, asserted verbatim by
# `a_read_only_manager_without_the_files_says_so` in the same file) — the
# single choke point every one of these routes' disk resolution goes
# through. But NOT every route puts that message in the HTTP body: reading
# each handler's error mapping (not guessing) found it genuinely differs —
#   - propagates the message into the JSON body: `sql/query`, `sql/{pathb64}`
#     (`agentic_error_response` → `SqlErrorResponse.message`, data.rs:198-206),
#     and `semantic`'s Warehouse branch (same helper).
#   - logs it, but the HTTP body is EMPTY (a bare `StatusCode`, no `Json`):
#     `databases/{name}/schema` (database.rs:96-113, doc comment says so
#     outright: "surface a 500 with the actual error logged"),
#     `databases/inspect-schemas` (database.rs:1113-1118),
#     `databases/inspect-schema-tables` (database.rs:1160-1167) — same
#     bare-`StatusCode`-no-`Json` pattern in all three.
#   - logs it, but the HTTP body is a GENERIC string that names nothing:
#     `metric-tree/explain`, `/opportunity`, `/distribution`, `/drill` — all
#     four fall through `MetricTreeError::Op(e.to_string())`, whose
#     `IntoResponse` arm discards `e` and sends the fixed string "Metric
#     tree operation failed" (metric_tree.rs:51-84).
# Asserting "the body names the working copy" against the second and third
# groups would just be this task's original mistake again, wearing a new
# shape — so the CALLER picks compare=workspace_local (status only) for
# those, and compare=workspace_local_named (status + body) only for the
# routes verified to actually carry the message. One mechanism, an honest

# `workspace_local`, same reasoning as databases-schema-local above.
#
# /inspect itself is a THIRD shape, not covered by either workspace_local
# variant: it is SSE and its handler always returns 200 (`Ok(Sse::new(rx))`
# unconditionally, database.rs:1071) — the refusal shows up as an
# `InspectEvent::Error` event INSIDE that 200 stream, not as a status code,
# so ide and serve genuinely agree on status here (200/200) and this stays
# `status`-compared. That status agreement is true, just shallow — it won't
# catch the ide's stream ending Complete against a replica's ending Error;
# noted rather than building a fourth bespoke assertion shape for one route.
# CORRECTED: mounted `post(...)` too (workspace.rs:608) — a GET measured a
# uniform 405 on all three nodes live. Uniform-and-wrong is worse than an
# ordinary failure here: `status` compare only checks agreement, so all

  #
  # Why: `metric-tree/opportunity` costs 8.7s on an idle node (measured alone,

  # one 10-core box, every node contending for CPU — all three then blew the

  # enough to take the next ~15 cases down with it. In the run before this
  # change every single `000` fell in one contiguous band that opened exactly
  # at this case and closed 50 log lines later, taking secrets, anomalies,
  # airway and sql-query with it — none of which are slow, and none of which
  # had anything to do with each other.
  #
  # So the deadline was never the problem: 30s is generous for an 8.7s call.
