#
# One command for both halves of the suite.
#
# Group A (`scripts/fleet-assert.sh`) fires every declared route at a real
# three-node fleet and compares bodies. Group B drives the browser flows. Both
# already existed; what did not was a way to run them without knowing which of
# four different invocations each flow needs. Getting that wrong does not fail
# loudly — it fails as a locator timeout that reads exactly like a product bug,
# which cost a full session to diagnose once already.
#
# The four invocations, and why they differ:
#
#   fleet   flows aimed at the docker fleet's serve replica: the 8 that
#           `scripts/fleet-assert.sh` owns, plus the 6 nothing used to run
#           (phase 2). Need a minted session (OXY_SESSION_TOKEN) plus
#           OXY_PATH_PREFIX, or every page redirects to /login and every step
#           times out. Phase 2 splits into five invocations — see the comment
#           there for which constraint each boundary is.
#   runner  demo_project flows the runner backs itself: `oxy start
#           --enterprise`, `oxy seed` of demo_project/ as the Demo workspace,
#           then a dev-login session as flow@oxy.local (runner/backend.ts,
#           runner/session.ts). Enterprise mode, like every phase here.
#   cloud   admin flows against an `oxy start --enterprise` this script starts
#           and fills with `oxy seed ./examples` first — the admin surfaces and
#           the airway run page need the staff identity and the partner
#           tenants, and no UI path creates an org any more.
#   obs     flows that read ClickHouse. No seed path exists for observability
#           data, so the spans are inserted directly (the shape
#           `just clickhouse-obs-verify` uses) rather than paying for agent runs.
#
# EVERY flow phase seeds first, through `scripts/seed-fixtures.sh`, and that
# script verifies its own work over HTTP before any flow starts. It is not
# ceremony: an unseeded target fails a flow on its FIRST locator, three minutes
# in, with a message that reads exactly like a broken page. Nine of the fourteen
# fleet/obs flows here failed that way and none of them were product bugs.
#
# Exit codes match fleet-assert's contract, because a runner that cannot tell
# them apart is worse than no runner:
#   0  everything asserted and passed
#   1  the product is wrong
#   2  could not test (missing key, image older than the source, docker down)
#
# Usage:
#   just verify                 # everything, against what is already built
#   just verify --build         # rebuild the fleet image first
#   just verify --group a       # HTTP only
#   just verify --group b       # browser flows only
#   just verify --keep          # leave the stacks up to poke at
#   just verify --dry-run       # print every flow invocation, run none of them
#
# `--dry-run` exists because "which flows does this actually run?" was, until
# now, a question you answered by reading three files and hoping. It prints the
# exact argv each phase would hand the runner — the SAME array, through the same
# `flow_run` door, not a hand-maintained copy that can drift — and touches
# nothing: no seed, no container toggle, no backend spawn, no API key spent.

#                 (runtimes/bespoke.ts). `flow@oxy.local` is an org owner with no
#                 platform standing and is what every WORKSPACE flow needs; the
#                 SPA bounces staff off a tenant workspace into /admin. The admin
#                 and partner surfaces need the opposite — `e2e@oxy.tech`, which
#                 `/api/customer-apps` and `/api/admin/partners` answer and a
#                 non-staff caller gets a 403 from.
#   backend_mode  all six are enterprise (`cloud`, the default) now, but cli.ts
#                 still refuses a mixed invocation, so a flow opting into the
#                 legacy `local` mode would need an invocation of its own.
#   assume-role   partners-console-fleet opens a 60-minute assume session as

#                 is client-side redirected to /partners — so it runs alone, and
#                 after admin-airhouse-fleet, and its last case stops the session.
#   ide state     ide-unavailable-fleet asserts what a DEAD ide node looks like.
#                 The harness deliberately cannot stop a container from inside a
#                 flow (see that flow's header), so the toggle is bracketed here
